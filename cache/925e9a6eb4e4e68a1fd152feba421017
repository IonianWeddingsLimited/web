You NEED Ionian Weddings to help you plan the big day! What now?</p>
<p>Let?s start with the proposals; these are packages we put together based on a ceremony and reception at one of our handpicked destinations across the Greek Islands, Cyprus, Malta, Italy and Croatia. We usually base these packages on 20 people including the Bride and Groom, and include the essentials such as photography, flowers, a wedding cake, reception meal and more.</p>

<p>Our packages are black and white. What you see, is most definitely what you get so any extras you add to the existing package, such as upgraded photography (and I personally recommend this), entertainment, decorations, a helicopter ride for two, donkey transfer for the Bride etc. are quoted individually helping you stay on track budget wise.</p>
<p>What if I have more or less than 20 people, I hear you ask? Don?t worry. We will request your final numbers closer to your wedding date so you?ll have most, if not all, of your RSVP?s back by then.</p>
<p>My package includes a Bridesmaids posy but I don?t have a Bridesmaid, can I remove this item? Of course you can. Our packages are bespoke which means we tailor each one to suit your preferences.</p>
<p>Call, email, Skype us! Let?s check availability of your venues. You can choose the day you get married on, you won?t have to wait to find out until you arrive at the destination. Once we?ve confirmed the availability for you, let?s secure this with a small deposit so no one else can take your date and venue. We work with very unique venues which are sort after so this is no time to delay.</p>
<p>Hooray! You?ve put your deposit down and your date has been confirmed. What now? It?s now time to RELAX!</p>
<p>We will contact you closer to your wedding date so we can begin to personalise the package and tailor it to suit you. We can do this over the phone, email, Skype or why not pop in and discuss this with us over a coffee (and a biscuit!)? Having your own wedding planner in the UK means you?ll speak to the same person about your wedding right up until the day you leave for Greece, Cyprus, Malta, Italy or Croatia. When you arrive at your destination, you?ll have a coordinator on hand to look after you throughout your stay too!</p>

<p>The relationship of gay couples will receive formal recognition by the State in a union that will enjoy the same rights and obligations of marriage.

<p>We have a wide range of wedding venues for you to choose from in Malta. From Palaces, to Castles, to Farmhouse?s to Vineyards. Here is my personal top 5 venues:</p>
<p><strong>Maltese Palace</strong></p>
<p>The Maltese Palace is a fantastic venue for your ceremony and reception in Malta because it has an endless amount of character, class and grandeur. The Palace offers a variety of rooms, terrace?s and gardens to hire privately. Each room enchanted with different theme?s to suit everybody?s personal wedding dreams. With your dining tables set out in a cross shape (in representation of the Maltese flag) or even in the garden lawn itself both floor plan designs create a unique and stylish feel to compliment both your grand wedding theme and the Palace itself.</p>

<p>Overall this venue is perfect for couples who are looking for sparkle, elegance, grandeur and Maltese tradition with a chance to relax and enjoy the party after hours!</p>
<p><strong>Heritage Gardens</strong></p>
<p>If you are looking for a unique wedding venue 100% I would recommend the Heritage Gardens! This venue descends below ground level without a roof, leaving your wedding party able to sit under the stars on your special day. The venue has two different scenic areas (garden and quarry area) to distinct your ceremony and reception all within the same venue. With a manmade waterfall and special effects this provides a unique backdrop to blow all your guests away on your big day.</p>

<p><strong>Farmhouse</strong></p>
<p>The Maltese Farmhouse is perfect for those looking for rustic Mediterranean themed wedding. The venues charm is beckoned from the beautiful grapevine ceilings, open air ovens, balustraded terraces, poolside views, and open air ovens. If you are looking for an intimate and private affair I would high recommend the Farmhouse.</p>

<p><strong>Maltese Castle</strong></p>
<p>If you are looking for complete exclusivity for your special day I would recommend the Maltese Castle all the way. You can be a King or Queen for the day in your very own Castle. The beauty of this venue is your wedding party will have sole and full access of the Castle itself the Castle grounds leaving your wedding party to relax and enjoy the breath taking surroundings. Both children and adults will love this wedding venue so I will always highly recommended.</p>

I had always heard people talking about the ?Corfu Bug? but I never really knew what they were referring to until I experienced it for myself. The island pulses with energy, from the greenery, the smells, the beaches, the mountains, the history, the people and the cats! Every inch of the island is unique and special, and needs to be explored in one?s lifetime, as I did. Everyone who leaves Corfu leaves with a little piece of it in their heart. This is what is known as the ?Corfu Bug?.</p>
<p>There is more to Corfu than meets the eye; there is Kavos the lively party resort and Sidari the popular family resort, but you also have the magic of Paleokastritsa, where you will experience the clearest and bluest of oceans, the charming fishing village of Kassiopi, Barbati, famed for its beaches and of course, Corfu Town itself, the Venetian heartbeat of the island.</p>

<p><strong>What can we do in Corfu?</strong></p>
<p>Corfu offers civil ceremonies, a non-denominational wedding service which is legally binding, blessings and renewal of vows for couples who have been previously married, Catholic Church ceremonies and Orthodox Church ceremonies.</p>
<p><strong>Where can we do it?</strong></p>
<p>We have many venues dotted around the island to suit all preference; a 5* luxury hotel, a modern beachfront taverna, an Old Fortress restaurant, a private villa offering stunning sea views, a traditional, family run taverna, a Palace fit for a Queen and much more.</p>
<p><strong>When can we go?</strong></p>
<p>Corfu is not called the ?Emerald Island? for nothing; it?s one of the greenest islands in Greece due to its wet climate. Fear not as this is usually out of ?season? so May to September is recommended.</p>
<p><strong>OK, I?m sold! What do I do next?</strong></p>

<p><img alt="image" src="https://31.media.tumblr.com/d0bdf2f47239674d754a0752ec244e49/tumblr_inline_n20yg2VuB31rqlgqs.jpg"/></p>
<p><strong>What can we do in Corfu?</strong></p>
<p>Corfu offers civil ceremonies, a non-denominational wedding service which is legally binding, blessings and renewal of vows for couples who have been previously married, Catholic Church ceremonies and Orthodox Church ceremonies.</p>
<p><strong>Where can we do it?</strong></p>
<p>We have many venues dotted around the island to suit all preference; a 5* luxury hotel, a modern beachfront taverna, an Old Fortress restaurant, a private villa offering stunning sea views, a traditional, family run taverna, a Palace fit for a Queen and much more.</p>
<p><strong>When can we go?</strong></p>
<p>Corfu is not called the ?Emerald Island? for nothing; it?s one of the greenest islands in Greece due to its wet climate. Fear not as this is usually out of ?season? so May to September is recommended.</p>
<p><strong>OK, I?m sold! What do I do next?</strong></p>
<p>Fill out our short wedding questionnaire and/or call Jessica to find out more about this incredible island.</p>
<p>We won?t be able to keep it a secret for much longer!</p>";s:14:"date_timestamp";i:1394126160;}i:8;a:8:{s:5:"title";s:59:"Ionian Weddings presents...

<p><u>The Mama Mia! Movie </u></p>
<p>If you have seen the amazing Mamma Mia! Film Skopelos comes to life in the following locations:</p>
<ul><li>Kastani Bay and beach, where &#8220;Does Your Mother Know&#8221; was performed</li>
<li>The Greek Monastery for the wedding chapel</li>
<li>Amarantos</li>
<li>Nisi</li>
<li>The beach and cliffs above Glisteri (Glysteri)</li>
</ul><p><img src="https://31.media.tumblr.com/3350e4b21ac09f02697d94ca694c5d8a/tumblr_inline_n0f7pfCNqF1rqlgqs.png"/></p>

<p><u>Flights</u></p>
<p>To get to the untouched island of Skopelos  you will need to get a flight to its neighbouring island, Skiathos, first and then take a small boat ride to Skopelos. The boat will take approximately 45 minutes from Skiathos. To get to Skiathos flights usually run between May and September.</p>
<p> <u>Wedding timeline</u></p>
<p>The wedding ceremony time can take place any time you request. We will always advise a later ceremony time from 16:00 onwards because the heat can be extremely hot during peak summer months. Especially when you are climbing 220 steps you may want to tackle this when it is a bit cooler.</p>
<p><u>Opportunities &amp; Extras</u></p>
<p>There are many optional extras you may want to include for you special wedding day, for example:</p>
<ul><li>Why not add 2 Skopelian musicians to your wedding package? Your musicians will provide that extra special feeling to your ceremony and reception</li>
<li>Just like the film, the bride can hire a donkey to take you up to the Mama Mia Chapel?</li>
<li>Why not add a DJ or Greek dancers to provide that little extra entertainment for your wedding?</li>

<p><strong>Why did you choose the traditional Inn and Cyprus for your wedding? </strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Traditional Inn was always what I had imagined a Cypriot wedding would be; my own ?Mamma Mia? style wedding exclusive to me! It is set away of the main tourist area and hustle and bustle of Paphos, but easy to access via car hire or taxi. It?s set back on the way up to Troodos Mountains, amongst trees, vines and the mountain in the back drop. The traditional feel of the inn itself made us and our guests smile.</p>
<p>I liked the fact that they used 3 areas for your wedding. The ceremony itself took place in the rear courtyard under vines, flowers and the sunshine. Then for the wedding breakfast you move into a long courtyard (a few steps away) to the most amazing wedding table I have ever seen. Then, you can move around the pool area for the rest of the night filled with dancing, laughing all under the stars!</p>
<p>We wanted our wedding to be magical, exclusive to us with a bit Cypriot tradition in an amazing, beautiful location and all of this is what the Traditional Inn gave us.</p>

<p><strong>Was it your first time in Cyprus? What did you think? </strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>No it was not the first time in Cyprus; we had been to Cyprus a few times on holiday. When we started looking at wedding venues in England none of them really stood out to us. My partner then suggested we looked at getting married in Cyprus. We both loved the island and could not think of a more beautiful place to get married. We like the island as it is easily accessible; you can be in the main tourist areas with all the shops, bars and restaurants or in a few minutes drive be on a beach or up near the mountains on an adventure. Cyprus has got a bit of everything to suit all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>How did your guests react when you said you were getting married in Cyprus?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Their first reaction was ?wow that?s different!?  They had never been to a wedding aboard before and wanted to know when and where; they all said it was very ?us?. We planned a party of 20 guests of close family and friends, inviting more assuming not all would be able to come. We ended up with 35 guests! Many used our wedding as their main holiday that year.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>And how did they react on the big day? What did they think of the venue?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>On the day, they were all very excited for everything the day would hold. They had heard stories about the Inn and seen pictures on the internet, which do not do justice showing off the beauty of the place. I booked a mini bus for all my guests from a main point in Paphos; as they turned up towards the mountain they started to think where are we going! On arrival, they were amazed by the venue and its surroundings. They loved it and could not believe how beautiful it all looked. All my guests said they felt very relaxed and the whole day was filled with sunshine and smiles.</p>

<p><strong>Please describe the most memorable moment from your big day</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The most memorable moment from my big day was walking down the stairs with my Dad, sister and my niece from my room where I got ready. I was so nervous and my legs were shaking and when I turned the corner there were all my guests looking at me and my husband to be waiting at the bottom of the stairs. It made all the nerves go away seeing all the smiling faces and the sun shining down on us. From this moment, all the planning, hard work and saving had come together and I could not have been happier.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Would you recommend a wedding abroad and if so why?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Definitely, yes! Everyone I dealt with was friendly, easy and would go out of their way to help. You can make the day exactly what you want. Cyprus is renowned for weddings and now I know why. The weddings are cheaper in cost but by no means in value and experience. The suppliers and planners deal with weddings everyday and have so much knowledge, help and advice to give; nothing was hard work.</p>
<p>The warm, relaxed atmosphere plus the friendly and helpful people make having your wedding aboard easy, enjoyable and I would do it all again in a heartbeat.</p>

<p>I am really excited to begin 2014 with 2 new wedding locations in Italy. They are destinations that I know really well and have visited dozens of times: <a href="http://www.ionianweddings.co.uk/destinations/italy/venice/" target="_blank">Venice</a> and <a href="http://www.ionianweddings.co.uk/destinations/italy/lake-garda-weddings/" target="_blank">Lake Garda</a>.</p>

<p></p>
<p>I remember the first time I visited Venice when I was a student in Italy for the summer: I was mesmerised by this magical city built on the water and thought it the most romantic place I?d ever set eyes on. I?ve been back many times since and I still feel lost for words when I arrive, it?s just so beautiful. I returned a few months ago to seek out wedding venues.</p>
<p><img src="https://31.media.tumblr.com/1b074ac7e23018c0be0b561a04d60b66/tumblr_inline_myuec6VVZP1rqlgqs.jpg"/></p>

<p>In my opinion, Venice works really well for small intimate weddings as it is so romantic. But it also offers some amazing historic venues on the waterfront which would work wonderfully for a large and extravagant wedding. And <a href="http://www.ionianweddings.co.uk/packages/italy-wedding-packages/venice-palazzo-cavalli-wedding-panoramic-rooftop-reception/" target="_blank">prices are less than you might think&#8230;..</a></p>

<p></p>
<p>Lake Garda is a more laid back place with a lovely Mediterranean climate, surrounded by nature. My favourite Lake Garda wedding venues are two lakeside castles that can be combined with a reception in the heart of a quaint historic town or a lakeside restaurant which can be hired privately.</p>
<p><img src="https://31.media.tumblr.com/e8337ca640750c55e6acda04c66b6b6d/tumblr_inline_myuefjNtx11rqlgqs.jpg"/></p>

<p><br/>Both Venice and Lake Garda are easily reached from the UK with regular direct flights to Venice and to Verona, Venice or Milan for Lake Garda.</p>
<p>Guests will be delighted to attend a wedding at either location as both have so much to offer the visitor. There is no minimum stay for a wedding in Italy so you can opt for a weekend ceremony and your guests can come out for a long weekend while you can begin married life in one of the many amazing hotels in these areas?or why not honeymoon in another Italian city such as Rome or Florence?</p>

<p>1) <a href="http://www.ionianweddings.co.uk/destinations/greek-aegean-islands/rhodes/" title="Ionian Weddings - Rhodes " target="_blank">Rhodes: Pefkos Wedding</a></p>
<p>Pefkos is my favourite ceremony and reception wedding venue in Rhodes for many, many, many, reasons. Firstly I believe the town of Pefkos is the perfect setting to escape from the hustle and bustle of Rhodes. This venue provides complete escapism and therefore gives you a lovely mix of exclusivity and authentic ambience from the locals for you and your guests to enjoy.</p>
<p>I especially love the panoramic views and sunset opportunities at Pefkos in Rhodes. The reception area seems effortless due to its laid back wooden chairs and long tables, this really provides a more close family feeling for your wedding party.</p>
<p>For me, the most important aspect about this venue is the scope of wedding details the couple can get involved with. With the best of both worlds, this venue doesn?t need too much to dress it up and equally is a great blank canvas for couples to put a creative stamp on their wedding day. With a simple touch of colour, centre pieces, sashes, floral arrangements, lanterns and last but not least fairy lights the whole venue can come alive. Every finer detail really blends with the sound of the ocean and sunset back drop.</p>
<p>This venue really has everything to offer! It has stylistic charm, uniqueness, ambiance as well as offering a great service in a beautiful setting. With the beach at your feet and the sunset in the horizon what more do you need? </p>
<ul><li><strong>Sunset opportunities</strong></li>
<li><strong>Panoramic views</strong></li>
<li><strong>Family friendly environment </strong></li>
<li><strong>Beach &amp; Terrace wedding opportunities </strong></li>
<li><strong>Excellent event and hospitality services </strong></li>
<li><strong>Endless opportunities to get creative</strong></li>

<p>2) <a href="http://www.ionianweddings.co.uk/destinations/malta/" title="Ionian Weddings - Malta " target="_blank">Malta: Maltese Palace Wedding</a></p>
<p>The Maltese Palace is my favourite venue for a ceremony and reception in Malta because it has an endless amount of character, class and grandeur. The Palace offers a variety of rooms, terrace?s and gardens to hire privately. Each room enchanted with different theme?s to suit everybody?s personal wedding dreams. Dependant on the weather, I would say my favourite area in the Palace is the outside first garden. With your dining tables set out in a cross shape (in representation of the Maltese flag) or even in the garden lawn itself both floor plan designs create a unique and stylish feel to compliment both your grand wedding theme and the Palace itself.</p>
<p>The Palace as a whole is extremely breath taking with its grand façade and traditional uniform. To complement the venue itself, there is also an opportunity for a knight to perform the ceremony (extra fees do apply)!</p>
<p>For me, one of the best feature?s this venue can offer is its private cellar. Maltese law requires all music to finish at 11pm. The Palace understands the importance a wedding party can be and so they offer their cellars to be hired privately after 11pm for the party to continue.</p>
<p>Overall this venue is perfect for couples who are looking for sparkle, elegance, grandeur and Maltese tradition with a chance to relax and enjoy the party after hours!</p>

<p>The Skiathos Beach Wedding package is, for me, the perfect ceremony and reception venue on the island. I believe this venue has so much character and stylish beach charm it is the perfect location for a relaxed wedding.</p>
<p>With the venues simplistic appearance on the outside it has so much to offer when looking from the inside outwards. This venue gives you the option on how barefoot you want to go onto the beach. The alternative raised wooden platform allows you to wine and dine from an almost touching distance to the sand and sea. Taking in your wedding day on one of Skiathos? famous beach whilst the sunset will dazzle you and your guests.</p>
<p>To make the most out of a Mediterranean wedding I believe this venue is the most chic, playful, hip, relaxed and stylish wedding Skaithos has to offer!</p>
<ul><li><strong>A perfect setting on the beach  </strong></li>
<li><strong>Relaxed atmosphere for you and your guests to relax</strong></li>
<li><strong>Charismatic, fashionable, trendy, chic venue </strong></li>

<p><span>Following our first scouting trip to Cyprus earlier this year, I returned from the second in the series recently having spent some time with familiar faces (and some new) in Santorini and Crete. These are two very different islands, with very different wedding venues, diverse facilities and essence. Santorini offers typical Cycladic cosmopolitan splendour and its majestic caldera panoramic views, while Crete is a relatively unknown hidden paradise with some incredible traditional wedding itineraries in farms, estates, chapels and beach locations across the island.</span></p>
<p><span><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/a700a7ffc6d4fae4b2fa1cbbfec34ddc/tumblr_inline_mpjcwlmwHi1qz4rgp.jpg"/></span></p>
<p><span>The trip got off to a very busy start with visiting familiar venues like Dana Villas and it was great to see the brand new terrace that will offer private wedding receptions, making this ideal for a couple wanting to do everything in the same place. La Maltese has now become a Small Luxury Hotel (SLH) meaning more space and larger outdoor areas, more white and a refreshed ambience. There were also a couple of fabulous new wedding venues in Santorini, a private villa made of locally sourced black stones that will be a new possibility to our clients: volcano view ceremony and reception, completely private villa accommodation, a retractable wind proof shield for the reception area with its own bar. Still, the old favourites like St Irene, Santo Winery, Pyrgos, Perivolos beach bar and Sunset Beach Bar have made some notable improvements to meet client expectations. Part of my role when speaking to the Greeks is to make them understand exactly what Ionian Weddings couples are looking for and making it possible. It?s not by chance that <em><strong>Ionian Weddings is officially now the number one wedding planning agency from the UK and number two from anywhere in the world for Santorini weddings</strong>.</em></span></p>

<p><span>After a spectacular overnight storm, I caught the Flying Cat to Heraklion for the second leg of my recce trip. The temperature was significantly hotter being further south in the Aegean and the planning begun over a glass of raki (local grappa drink) for the next few days. During day one I visited the Hersonissos and Agios Nikolaos areas starting to get a feel that something good was about to unfold. A purpose built private estate in the first was probably the best example, with lovely sea view chapel, large garden and reception grounds. While in Agios Nikolaos, I visited the lovely Spinaloga view taverna, new chic beach location and a remote part of the peninsula where boat weddings with on board BBQ meals can be achieved.</span></p>
<p><span><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/c53bcf7b8045a7f011d997c8ac1593f1/tumblr_inline_mpjddpUcB51qz4rgp.jpg"/></span></p>
<p><span>Georgioupolis, Gerani and Rethymno were on the agenda for day two. Meeting Chloe and Martyn, one of our couples that are getting married with us next year, made the day so much more fun! The beautiful chapel in Georgioupolis at the end of the stone path has now some very strong contenders with a new beach and palm tree garden beach bar for a relaxed wedding on the beach. One of the best locations of this trip was then discovered; an old estate country house for an exclusive stay and wedding in some very impressive gardens or the cobbled courtyard. We were then met by the new owner of our Fortezza View restaurant, an old favourite right on the water. Walking through the wonderful streets of Rethymno old town reminded of the narrow alleys in Corfu, both influenced by the once occupying Venetians.  The day was rounded off with some local tsikoudia with a hint of citrus which inevitably meant a small bottle was coming home!</span></p>
<p><span><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/4ee8adc5639a6bd6607b3c590af38392/tumblr_inline_mpjdl7IuuT1qz4rgp.jpg"/></span></p>
<p><span>On day three, we started by visiting some luxury hotels near Rethymno offering some lovely options for a beach wedding in Crete with style. Few minutes up the hill, we were greeted by the manager of a beautiful agricultural concept village boasting organic farming, spectacular views towards East Crete and some very tasty homemade delicacies. This is an ideal place for romantics and lovers of rural Crete. Back on the road through the back of Psiloritis Mountain with views of the south coast for a couple more unique venues for weddings. The first was a traditional winery producing award winning labels at the top of hill with views of ancient Gortyna and an entire olive tree laden valley!  The wedding at the chapel below boasts some of the best views I have seen anywhere and the wine itself won?t disappoint either. The chapel wedding ceremony can be then followed by reception within the winery itself. The last stop of the day was at our Secret Garden location on the way to Heraklio, a place that indulges the senses with a variety of plants, landscaped gardens, stone chapel and complete privacy.</span></p>

<p><span>On the final day of the trip after breakfast, I was shown around our lovely Private Beach wedding venue in Heraklio. Spread over beautiful golden sand, the beach offers a private bay for the ceremony, a separate bay for the reception and party and it?s complemented by a celebrity Greek chef and his tasty creations. At the end of the visit, I couldn?t help feeling that this will offer some amazing beach weddings to our couples. As the morning was fast disappearing, the less glamorous trip to the airport and flight home came about rather quickly. It had been an exhausting trip but hugely worthwhile with some fantastic new wedding venues and locations on the radar. There is so much to see and explore, every time, Greece always fascinates me!</span></p>

<p>One of the most intimate options is a private villa in the heart of Sorrento, just a few steps from Piazza Tasso, yet on the coast and offering impressive views of the Gulf of Naples below. Couples can either have a symbolic wedding at the villa followed by reception and complete private hire of the villa, or marry first at the nearby 14th Century San Francesco Cloisters and then walk through old Sorrento to reach the villa.</p>

<p>One of the most intimate options is a private villa in the heart of Sorrento, just a few steps from Piazza Tasso, yet on the coast and offering impressive views of the Gulf of Naples below. Couples can either have a symbolic wedding at the villa followed by reception and complete private hire of the villa, or marry first at the nearby 14th Century San Francesco Cloisters and then walk through old Sorrento to reach the villa.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if you are as captivated by citrus as the heroine of the film then a <a href="http://www.ionianweddings.co.uk/packages/italy-wedding-packages/sorrento-san-francesco-cloisters-wedding-lemon-garden-reception/" target="_blank">Lemon Garden Reception near the Sorrento San Francesco Cloisters </a>is a must, serving up delicious Italian cuisine and ending with their famous Lemon Delicious wedding cake!</p>

<p>We can even organise a private villa wedding and reception package at the very same villa featured in<em> Love Is All You Need</em>!</p>
