		<p>Cyprus is a very romantic place to get married because it is here that the Greek Goddess of Love, Aphrodite, was born.  For this reason it is often called the Island of Love.  With a very warm and sunny climate, English widely spoken and simple paperwork, Cyprus is the number one wedding destination for UK couples. Cyprus weddings can take place all over the island, most popular destinations are Paphos, Agia Napa / Protaras and Limassol.

		<h1>Cyprus as your wedding destination</h1>
		<p>Cyprus is the 3rd largest island in the Mediterranean and enjoys a very warm and sunny climate.  Even in December and January, Cyprus has 6 hours of sunshine!  It is a melting pot of cultures with influences from Greece and the UK of course but also from Turkey, Syria and the Lebanon.  Its sandy beaches, quaint villages and friendly locals draw tourists back year after year.  English and Greek are spoken by everyone.</p>
		<p>Like Greece, Cyprus has a rich history and has been occupied by the Greeks, Romans, Byzantines, Venetians, Ottomans, British and Turks to name a few. There are many fascinating archaeological sites to visit, particularly near Paphos and for those visiting in Spring and Autumn, walking in the Troodos mountains is a wonderful way to get away from it all.  There are many resorts to choose from with some for everyone: family friendly resorts and places to party the night away.</p>
