<h1>Crete as your wedding destination</h1>
<p>Greek Weddings in Crete are more spectacular than anywhere else in Greece. The &quot;big fat Greek wedding&quot; takes on new meaning here; it is not uncommon to have 2000 or more guests at a wedding in Crete!</p>
<p>Crete is the southernmost island in the Mediterranean and the largest island in Greece – both in size (8,261 square km) and character.  It offers more attractions than any other Greek island and really does have something for everyone – ancient archaeology, spectacular beaches, Venetian towns, unusual wildlife, dramatic scenery, delicious food and its unique type of music.</p>
<p>Crete is the home of the Minoan civilisation, the oldest form of civilisation in Europe and offers world famous archaeological sites such as Knossos, Phaistos and Gortis.</p>
<p>Crete was ruled by Venetians for more than 4 centuries and the historic coastal towns of Rethymno and Chania bear a remarkable similarity to Venice. For beach lovers there are 1,000 km of coastline to explore from secluded coves to large stretches of sand, and the resorts range from the exclusive VIP favourite of Elounda to the party atmosphere in Malia, and everything in between.</p>
<p>The scenery is dominated by huge mountain ranges, dramatic gorges (such as the world famous Samaria Gorge) and expanses of wildflowers, olive groves and aromatic herbs.  There are many wildlife, plants and flowers that are unique to the island such as the endangered Kri-Kri wild goat.</p>
<p>Those who venture inland will be rewarded by glimpsing a more traditional way of life where the locals live in charming stone hamlets alongside working donkeys and goat herds. Crete is also the home of famous painter El Greco and Nikos Kazantzakis, the author of Zorba the Greek, the mythical Minotaur in Knossos and Spinaloga, the former leper colony which inspired British author Victoria Hislop to write her bestselling novel, The Island.</p>

Day trips to the nearby ancient Delos island, a UNESCO World Heritage Site is a rewarding way of stepping back in time.</p>
<p>Landmarks of the island include the white cubist houses, golden sandy beaches, windmills dating back to the 16th century and Petros the Pelican, who has been in Mykonos town for 50 years! Well, at least Petros the Second is able to continue the legacy!</p>
<p>The capital town of Mykonos is beautifully chic with narrow streets lined with designer clothes shops, artists' studios, upmarket restaurants and trendy bars and clubs.  The nightlife in Mykonos is often rated as the best in Europe.  A wonderful place to watch the sunset with a cocktail is Little Venice where you find cafes and bars that lap the water's edge.

<h1>Santorini as your wedding destination</h1>
<p>Santorini, otherwise know as Thira, lies in the south of the Cyclades group of Aegean islands and is one of the most dramatic and spectacularly beautiful Greek islands. Your Santorini wedding will be blessed by a breathtaking setting overlooking the caldera and one of the most stunning sunsets in the world.</p>
<p>The island of Santorini has followed a remarkable journey through thousands of years, surfacing during volcanic eruptions from the earth's core. A trip to the nearby islets of Palea and Nea Kameni will take you to the heart of the volcano. Following the 1640BC eruption, the first civilisation settlement in Akrotiri was covered in volcanic ash and modern day excavations have brought to light a very important archaeological site with magnificent murals. The amphitheatre, colonnades and some 3000-year-old graffiti at the site of Ancient Thira are also worth a visit.</p>
<p>The Byzantine period settlers constructed the wonderful churches of Episkopi and Agia Irini (Santa Irene), whereas the French rule left behind the fortifications of Kastelia and Goulades towers. Due to its fertile soil, Santorini produces high quality wine, cherry tomatoes and fava (yellow split peas). Santonini's cultural heritage is further enriched by the famous cave houses (yposkafa) and captain's houses (kapetanospita) that can be found in Fira and Oia.</p>
<p>Santorini is an island of contrasting colours. There are many black sandy beaches such as Perissa, Vlihada and Kamari, the red sand beach of Akrotiri and the more secluded Columbo, Baxedes and Ammoudi. The white traditional Cycladic houses and blue-domed churches built on the black volcanic rock is a sight you will never forget.</p>

<p>Located only 6 miles from the Greek mainland, Skiathos is the smallest (46 square km) and most popular of the Sporades group of islands, set in the Aegean Sea.</p>
<p>The island boasts no less than 70 sandy beaches and if you choose to hire a boat, you will be rewarded by discovering romantic, deserted beaches, even in peak season. Or you may opt for a more traditional kaiki boat from the old port, similar to the one caught by Colin Firth and Pierce Brosnan in Mamma Mia.</p>
<p>Skiathos is one of the only islands in Greece that has never changed its name.  It is believed that its name comes from 'skia' the Greek word for shadow, either from the tall pine trees that cover the island, or because it lies in the shadow of the mountains of Pelion, across on the Greek mainland.</p>
<p>Skiathos is covered in pine forests and olive groves making it a lush, green island producing an abundance of olives, walnuts and fruit  By venturing inland you will discover traditional villages and much of the west and north coasts of the island are untouched by tourism.  By contrast, historic Skiathos town is a lively place where traditional churches and old houses on narrow streets mix with chic restaurants and designer shops.  Skiathos was famous in the past for the quality of its shipbuilding and you can still see the shipyards today in the port in Skiathos town.</p>
