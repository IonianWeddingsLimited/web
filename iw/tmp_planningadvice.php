		<p>The following is intended as a guide to the documents that you will need in order to have a civil wedding in Greece or Cyprus.  If you wish to have a Catholic, Anglican or Orthodox wedding, please <a href='?PTID=9' target='_self' title='contact us'>contact us</a> for more information. It may vary slightly from island to island and this information is subject to change, so please check with the relevant authorities beforehand.</p> 
		<p>If you use our services, we will provide you with up to date information, costs and full assistance with the paperwork.  We can even do most of the paperwork for you, for a small fee, to save you queuing at the embassy!  <a href='?PTID=9' target='_self' title='Contact us'>Contact us</a> for more information on our Documentation Service.</p>
		<p>Some islands require you to be on the island for a certain number of days before your wedding.  We can advise you which ones these are and which are more flexible. In general, you will need to send the following documentation over to Greece or Cyprus.  It should be sent a minimum of 2 months before your wedding:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Birth certificate (for each party).  These must be full birth certificates showing parents' names</li>
			<li>Certificate of non-impediment to marry for each party (for Greece) or declaration of freedom to marry signed by a solicitor (for Cyprus)</li>
			<li>Valid 10 year passports</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Please note that the Certificates of Non-Impediment are issued by your local Registrars after a 15 days notice. and are valid for 3 months only.  Therefore, you must make sure that their date of issue are less than 3 months before your wedding date.</p>
		<p>The following documents are also required where applicable:</p>
		<p>- Decree absolute bearing court seal, if you are divorced</p>
		<p>- Adoption certificate if you are entered into the registry of adopted children</p>
		<p>- Deed poll of change of name</p>
		<p>- Death certificate of deceased spouse if you are widowed</p>
		<p>Finally, for weddings in Greece only, all required documents will have to be:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Certified.</l1>
			<li>Translated into Greek by an approved translator.</li>
			<li>Once the documents have been translated, then they need to be authenticated.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Both the original and translated/legalised copies of ALL documents must be taken to Greece with you. After the wedding, in some town halls your original documents and translations may be kept. Your Greek marriage certificate will need to be translated into your native language on return home. The embassies and offices mentioned are for British citizens residing in the UK. If you are not British, you will need to contact the appropriate department or embassy in your own country.</p>
		<h1>Documentation service by Ionian Weddings</h1>
		<p>We can take care of the final stages of your legal paperwork (certification, translation and authentication) for a small fee. This will remove the stress of dealing with the authorities and your completed paperwork will be sent to Greece on your behalf. We will send you details with your wedding proposal once you submit your <a href='?PTID=8' target='_self' title='Wedding Questionnaire'>Wedding Questionnaire</a>.</p>

		<ul>
			<li><strong>Think about the type of wedding that you want, e.g. beach, culture, city, countryside.</strong>  This will help you to determine your priorities and choose the right location. Take into account who is coming to your wedding - ensure the venue is suitable for children and /or elderly guests. For smaller weddings, avoid large venues as they will feel less intimate.</li>
			<li><strong>Try to give your guests plenty of notice</strong> particularly if you would like many of your friends and family to join you. This will allow them to plan their trip and have a holiday around your wedding day.</li>
			<li><strong>Use a professional wedding consultancy / planner.</strong> They will do all the hard work for you and make recommendations, saving you a great deal of time and allowing you to create a unique wedding and to relax on the wedding day.</li>
			<li><strong>Make sure you are clear on the paperwork you will need.</strong>  Without it you will not be able to get married abroad and/or your wedding will not be valid once you are back home.  If you use a wedding planner, they can help you with this.</li>
			<li><strong>Book overseas wedding insurance.</strong></li>
			<li><strong>Keep your guests up to date with your wedding day plans.</strong> Set up a wedding website and use it to give your guests information on you and on your wedding destination.  You can also get feedback from them e.g. a list of their favourite songs solves the DJ playlist!</li>
			<li><strong>Brides, choose a suitable dress.</strong> Most wedding dress shops stock a range of destinatoin wedding dresses and can advise you on the most suitable fabrics for warmer destinations.  Be sure to purchase a box to put the dress in so that it travels well.</li>
			<li><strong>Incorporate elements of the local culture into your wedding.</strong>  For example a wedding in Greece could include a local bouzouki band or you could give each of your guests a small local gift as a memento.</li>
			<li><strong>Book a videographer</strong> so that your loved ones who cannot attend can still experience your special day. It is also a great way to remember your wedding abroad.</li>
			<li><strong>Organise a wedding party on your return.</strong> This will be a chance for those guests who were unable to attend your wedding abroad to share your special day with you and a chance to relive those memories with those that were there with you.</li>

		<p>Greece and Cyprus have many beautiful locations to inspire you to share your marriage vows once again.</p>
		<p>There are many reasons why couples choose to have a blessing/renewal of vows including:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Celebrating an anniversary, be it 10, 20 or 50 years</li>
			<li>A fresh new start to a relationship for whatever reason</li>

			<li>One of you had lost their original wedding ring and would like the new one blessed</li>
			<li>Surprise your spouse with a blessing ceremony to show them how much you love them</li>
			<li>Surprise your parents with a blessing ceremony to help them celebrate many good years of marriage, to show them how much they mean to you, to thank them for all the hard years of raising you and your siblings</li>
			<li>Bless your engagement rings as a start to your commitment that will lead you to marriage in the near future</li>
