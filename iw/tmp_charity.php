		<p>By choosing to have their wedding in Greece or Cyprus our couples are truly blessed by spending their special day in some of the most beautiful islands in the Mediterannean Sea. Rich in culture, flora and fauna, the area is also a haven for many rare creatures such as the Mediterannean Monk Seal (Monachus Monachus) and Caretta Caretta loggerhead sea turtle.</p>
		<p>Ionian Weddings promotes responsible tourism, make contributions to local wildlife and preservation projects and believe that local communities and wildlife should benefit from tourism. To this extent, we support conservation and protection initiatives in this area. In Zakynthos, we issue guidelines to all our wedding couples on how to safeguard the caretta caretta species in the water and their eggs on the beach. For every booking made on Turtle Island, Ionian Weddings donates a percentage of our profits to the National Marine Park of Zakynthos which protects the local turtles. We also support small local charities based on the islands such as the Agni Animal Welfare Fund in Corfu. Following the launch of our Spinaloga weddings in Crete, Andreas ran a marathon to raise money and awareness for LEPRA, the charity that aims restore health, hope and dignity to people affected by leprosy and other diseases of poverty.  In the past we have sponsored the Rainforest Foundation and Save the Rhino.</p>
		<p><strong>We also actively support charities closer to home.  Ionian Weddings is very proud to be sponsors of two charities local to our area of London.<br />Both provide invaluable support to children with additional needs and we have seen first hard the excellent work of these charities:</strong></p>
