<p>This is a truly unique wedding venue in Cyprus giving you the opportunity to enjoy exclusive use of a Cypriot winery on your wedding day.</p>
<p>The Cyprus Wine Museum is located in the village of Erimi and is significant as it stands at the crossroads of the traditional wine routes leading to the mountains and close to Kolossi castle and the medieval Grande Commanderie of the Knights Hospitaller who produced the world's oldest named wine &quot;Commandaria&quot;.</p>
<p>It is built in traditional style using local stone and features two beautiful courtyards - the Knights' Courtyard, surrounded by a stone wall and filled with bougainvillea and the Semele Courtyard, adorned with vines and pitharia.  There is also an indoor Hall with stonework and open fireplace.  All of these venues can be used for both your wedding ceremony and your reception.</p>
