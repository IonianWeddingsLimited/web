<p>This month we're showcasing the wedding of Victoria and Matthew Nichol in Santorini on 9 May 2009.</p>
<p>Victoria, Matthew and guests stayed at a boutique hotel in the south of the island which they hired exclusively.</p>
<p>The ceremony took place at a luxury hotel in Imerovigli.  During the day, the girls sunbathed on the terrace and enjoyed pampering before getting ready.  Victoria and Matthew exchanged vows on the terrazza on the caldera, with spectacular views looking out towards the pristine Aegean sea.  The guests then enjoyed champagne and watched the beautiful sunset.</p>
<p>The reception took place in the hotel, where guests enjoyed a sumptuous meal prepared by the award winning chefs.  A dj played until late and then the guests were transported back to their hotel to carry on partying until the sun came up.</p>
<h2>Here's what Victoria said about the preparation for her magical day:</h2>
<p><em>Choosing the island of Santorini to get married on was an adventure in itself. With the help of Ionian weddings we travelled around four of the Greek islands to find our dream wedding location. We visited Crete, Naxos, Amorgos and Santorini and unbelievably on every island we found great locations to have our wedding! Eventually it was the views and hotels on the island of Santorini that ticked our boxes.</em></p> 
<p><em>With the help of Ionian we found a perfect hotel in the secluded Vlychada resort with 30 Bedrooms perfect for our 56 guests and with the most fantastic spa and poolside area. The sister hotel in Imerovigli with its fantastic views over the Caldera is where we chose to have our wedding and reception. Over the following 12 months Ionian Weddings helped plan every last detail of our dream wedding including my very specific request for flowers that needed to be imported onto the island.</em></p>
<p><em>Ionian Weddings made every part of the planning process as easy as possible. Organising the wedding paperwork was not a daunting task with Andreas to help and as he's Greek we didn't have to worry about a thing. Ionian Weddings helped us find the lowest costs and the best services for all our needs. The service Ionian Weddings provided in planning our wedding made getting married abroad so much easier and an experience that we just want to go back and do all over again!</em></p>
<p><em>It was the best day of our lives, and we'll never forget it.  Thank you!!</em></p>";

<p>Abi and Chris had a very special wedding in Corfu in the summer of 2009. The ceremony took place at the heart of the historic town and it was followed by waterfront reception inside the Venetian Old Fortress. They both regularly go abroad as Chris is a pilot and Abi cabin crew, so a dream wedding in the Greek islands was not a difficult decision. In the interview below, they describe their experience, how they met and why they chose Corfu over so many other exotic destinations.</p>
<h2>Did you meet during a flight? Is &quot;cabin romance&quot; something that happens a lot?</h2>
<p>We flew together to Catania, Sicily so we met somewhere above the French Alps.  I had always said I would never date a pilot so, never say never!!! We have quite a few friends now who have met onboard as crew and are now married or getting married.</p>
<h2>Was the proposal during a flight? Please give details</h2>
<p>As we met above the Alps, Chris took me to Morzine skiing and arranged for a horse drawn sleigh to take us on a ride and stop at a viewpoint so that Chris could propose to me.  It was how I had always envisaged my wedding to be, on a snowy mountain, but to be proposed to that way was perfect.</p>
<h2>Why did you choose Corfu over the many exotic destinations you fly to?</h2>
<p>Corfu has always had a special place in my heart.  This year was my 25th year of visiting Corfu as I have family that live there.  Chris had been with me once on the QE2 which was amazing and then again on a 2 week holiday and he too fell in love with the Island.  It's so relaxing; the scenery is stunning and the locals so welcoming.  Yes we do fly to many exotic destinations but whenever friends or indeed passengers ask me my favourite destination, Corfu always wins.</p>
<h2>What is the feeling you get as cabin crew when you approach Corfu?</h2>
<p>I have operated into Corfu many times with a previous airline and have landed in all kinds of weather which can make it interesting, but this time when we landed it was a very exciting time as I knew it was the last time I would be landing anywhere in the world as Miss Abi Ballam.</p>
<h2>Did you build into the wedding plans anything to remind you of what you do?</h2>
<p>I had a professional cake topper made of the pair of us.  Chris in his pilot's uniform and myself in my wedding dress.  I just had to send her some pictures of Chris in his uniform. It turned out brilliantly.</p>
<h2>Would you say that you had an edge over other brides because of your knowledge of the travel industry?</h2>
<p>No not really, we entrusted Ionian Weddings to take care of everything and you did a brilliant job.  With regular flights throughout the summer popping over before the wedding is something I would recommend if you have the time and money.  It helped ease the pre-wedding nerves.</p>
<h2>Was it helpful that you decided to get married short haul?</h2>
<p>We thought that a lot more guests would be unable to come to Corfu due to the credit crunch but we were pleasantly surprised out of 75 invites we had 69 guests.  I think making it a short haul destination definitely helped our guests manage to afford to come.</p>
<h2>What would you advise brides that wish to marry abroad?</h2>
<p>Put your trust into the hands of Ionian Weddings. They arrange weddings everyday and are available by email or at the end of the phone if you need reassurance.  I must admit I was a little stressed due to the language barrier dealing with locals over the phone but face to face and email was much easier.  This needn't happen if you leave everything to the professional care of the Ionian Weddings team, that's what they are there for!</p>";

<h2>How did you two meet and where did the proposal take place?</h2>
<p>We met 13 years ago at my first job at Heathrow; Paul was one of my directors!  I fell in love with him the first day I met him, when I was greeted with a big smile, a cup of coffee and the morning paper, 2 minutes after I had sat at my desk!  WHAT A LOVELY START TO MY FIRST JOB!</p>
<p>The proposal took place at the Basilica ruins opposite St Stefanos Island where we eventually got married (about 6 years before the wedding!) Paul got down on one knee on a beautiful day in Kefalos, asked me to be his wife and said he would marry me over the water at the little church on the island one day!</p>
<h2>Why did you choose Greece and Kos for your wedding?</h2>
<p>We started travelling to Kos a year after meeting each other and apart from a couple of exceptions have been travelling there every year since; we love Kos, especially Kefalos.</p>
<h2>Was it your first time in Kos?  What did you think?</h2>
<p>We booked a last minute holiday and arrived in Kefalos at lunchtime on a Saturday.  We were very tired from the early start but couldn't help exploring the place when we got there.  The majority of everything is on the waterfront, and we are BIG lovers of the sea, so Kefalos is our most perfect place in the world to relax and while away the hours watching the sun go down over the harbour.</p>
<h2>How did you prepare for your wedding in Greece? Was it was you expected?</h2>
<p>As I said before we had always wanted to get married on the little island and had seen just a few weddings take place there over the years.  I had searched and searched for someone to organise if for us when I came upon Ionian Weddings who had my dream wedding idea on their site after 6 years of searching!!</p>
<h2>Please describe the most memorable moment from your big day.</h2>
<p>I can honestly say the whole day was so perfect there wasn't one moment that stood out as the most memorable, the whole day was!</p>
<h2>Is there anything quirky or funny that reminds you of your Greek wedding experience?</h2>
<p>My auntie Margaret missing the coach and the boat and frantically searched every harbour in Kos to find the wedding, and eventually found Kefalos and persuaded a local to take her and her partner Gary across to the Island for the ceremony!</p>
<h2>What advice would you give to other brides considering getting married in Greece?</h2>
<p>Greece is such a perfect place to marry because of its outstanding beauty in the country itself, its people and its traditions.  Kos is especially beautiful, namely Kefalos, the St Stefanos wedding provides an unforgettable setting that you, your family and your guests will treasure forever.</p>
<p>I would just like to add how fantastic Ionian Weddings were here in the UK and their calming approach on all the prep before. You helped calm my wedding nerves every step of the way, taking every bit of stress of a wedding away from me! And finally the local team in Kos, I wasn't the easiest to deal with, as I am a stickler for detail, but Ionian Weddings had everything under control and the rest of the team were professional throughout and great fun on the day!</p>";

<h2>How did you two meet and where did the proposal take place?</h2>
<p>We actually met on Facebook. Started talking and went out for a drink. Nine hours later, we were still in the pub. It was a good first date! The first proposal took place in a beer garden at a local folk festival then after asking for my dad's permission, the second took place in Dublin. That was 4 months after we met.</p>
<h2>Why did you choose Greece and Zakynthos for your wedding? And why Agios Sostis Island?</h2>
<p>We really wanted to get married on the beach and ideally wanted somewhere short haul so more of our friends could come. Greece is such a beautiful country so we were really happy when we found out we could get married there. Agios Sostis island looked truly breathtaking and knowing that we could hire it exclusively, allowing us to have privacy during our ceremony made it an easy choice.</p>
<h2>Was it your first time in Zante?  What did you think?</h2>
<p>We travelled to Zante the year before the wedding to have a look at the private Island, the reception venues and to meet up with the local coordinator. At the end of the holiday, we knew we had made the right choice about getting married on Zante and Agios Sostis Island with Ionian Weddings.</p>
<h2>How did your guests react to your wedding in Greece? And after?</h2>
<p>They thought it was the most amazing wedding location ever. They loved the island of Zante and lots of them are planning to return, including us!</p>
<h2>Please describe the most memorable moment from your big day.</h2>
<p>The ceremony took place in the evening so we had spent the evening before and the whole day apart. Seeing each other for the first time on our wedding day was very special and something we will both remember. It was emotional.</p>
<h2>Is there anything quirky or funny that reminds you of your Greek wedding experience?</h2>
<p>We chartered a boat a couple of days before the wedding and the captain turned up at the ceremony. In the group shot of all our friends, you can just make out Panos the boat captain behind one of our friends.</p>
<h2>What advice would you give to other brides considering getting married in Greece?</h2>
<p>If you want a truly unique and romantic location that you will remember for the rest of your life, then you can't do better than Agios Sostis Island. Ionian Weddings were so helpful in planning every detail. We were initially worried about the relaxed approach to doing things in the Mediterranean but after dealing with Ionian Weddings, I knew we would have no problems. It was a truly amazing day and we thank everyone involved from the bottom of our hearts for making the best day of our lives, the best it could be.</p>";

<h2>How did you two meet and where did the proposal take place?</h2>
<p>Met at work! We were friends for around 3 years before romance blossomed. Nathan proposed on one knee in a restaurant called Piano Rouge, in Krakow, Poland (totally unexpected)</p>
<h2>Why did you choose Greece and Kefalonia for your wedding?</h2>
<p>Greece because we have both always loved the country, food, people and climate! Kefalonia was a suggestion from Andreas and we went out there in May 2009 to see what it was like and immediately fell in love with the Island.</p>
<h2>Was it your first time to Kefalonia? What did you think?</h2>
<p>The most beautiful, peaceful and relaxed place - perfect for the wedding we wanted.</p>
<h2>How did you prepare for your wedding in Greece? Was it what you expected?</h2>
<p>We did a lot of internet research and found that Ionian Weddings were coming up with the best ideas to match our wishes. It was more than we expected - very relaxed and we wish we could do it all again.</p>
<h2>Please describe the most memorable moment from your big day.</h2>
<p>Seeing each other for the first time as we metat the chapel and being serenaded down from the chapel to the taverna by mandolin.</p>
<h2>Is there anything quirky or funny that reminds you of your Greek wedding Experience?</h2>
<p>Yes! Just how laid back it was - even beyond our expectations and the fact that the villagers joined in the reception!</p>
<h2>What advice would you give to other brides considering getting married in Greece?</h2>
<p>If you don't want to get rained on (ok, less likely to be rained on), if you want to cut down on all the wedding hype/stress and expense associated with weddings here and for all your guests to have the best time - take the risk!</p>
<h2>Anything else you would like to add?</h2>
<p>Tell Andreas exactly what you want and if it's possible he'll sort it.</p>

<h2>How did you two meet and where did the proposal take place?</h2>
<p>We met in the middle of the North Sea! We both came to be working on the same oil Platform at the same time. This was 9 years ago and whilst I am still on the same Platform, Ricky is on a different one. The proposal took place on the doorstop of our house after Ricky surprised me by getting off the platform early.</p>
<h2>Why did you choose Greece and Zakynthos for your wedding?</h2>
<p>We chose Greece as lots of family and friends wanted to come over so we decided that short haul was best! We both love Greece anyway and wanted a very laid back wedding on the beach. After looking into all the Islands, we decided that Zakynthos was the place for us as it looked stunning and had plenty to see and do. When we read the proposal Ionian Weddings sent us for the wedding we knew we had made the right choice.</p>
<h2>How easy was it planning a wedding from the North Sea?</h2>
<p>Access to the internet when offshore made it a whole lot easier! I had lots of contact with Ionian Weddings which helped keep me calm. The most stressful part was when we were arranging our certifications of non - impediment and I got stuck offshore for an extra six days due to the volcanic eruptions. I thought I would miss our appointments for the certificates and that the whole wedding would be doomed! Luckily the platform arranged for me to get off by boat and I made it to the appointment with a couple of hours to spare.</p>
<h2>Was it your first time to Zante? What did you think?</h2>
<p>Ricky had been to Zakynthos 20 years previously on holiday but couldn't really remember it and I had never been before. We tried to get over before the wedding but our rotas weren't working out for going. Therefore it was all lovely and exciting and a 'surprise' when we went. We loved Zakynthos - it is very beautiful, friendly and laid back. All of our guests thought so too and many are planning to return.</p>
<h2>How did your guests react to your wedding in Greece? And after?</h2>
<p>Everyone enjoyed the wedding a huge amount and said it was unlike any wedding they had been to before, and was the best wedding ever! Everything from the location to the flowers to the fireworks and Greeks dancing was enjoyed by all. They all enjoyed the island so much that we will be having a reunion there in 2 years time!</p>
<h2>Please describe the most memorable moment from your big day.</h2>
<p>The whole day was truly amazing and so happy and emotional, it was perfect for us. We had around 48 guests and being surrounded by so many family and friends really made our day. Lots of things stand out but to name a few the beautiful setting on the beach, and going around Tsilvi town in the horse and carriage to cheers after the ceremony and standing watching the fireworks on the beach at night was truly unforgettable. It was a very romantic day.</p>
<h2>Is there anything quirky or funny that reminds you of your Greek wedding experience?</h2>
<p>So many! The day was filled with laughter. From Ricky promising to cook for me once a week in his wedding vows to the horse that started reared when we were in the horse and carriage (it was part of the show!) an also the Greek dancer who put my sister over his shoulder and twirled her around. Too many magic funny moments to name them all!!!</p>
<h2>What advice would you give to other brides considering getting married in Greece?</h2>
<p>First of all I would encourage anyone to get married in Greece, such a different beautiful and romantic setting. I would also advise them to get in touch with Ionian Weddings who will help and advise them the whole way through. They can be assured that both Ionian Weddings and the wedding coordinators in Greece will give them the best day they have ever had. I am sure that all the locations available are spectacular, though for us our Beach wedding on Tsilivi was everything we could have wished for and more.</p>
<p>We would like to thank Andreas and Jane from the bottom of our hearts for our brilliant wedding which we and our guests will treasure forever. Nothing was too much trouble and all the reassurance was very calming! It was the very best start to married life that we could imagine.</p>

<h2>How did you two meet and where did the proposal take place?</h2>
<p>Nick and I have known each other since we were teenagers and met up again in Tesco's on a sunny August Bank Holiday!!! Nik proposed to me in Samos whilst we were on holiday there in 2008.</p>
<h2>Why did you choose Greece and Samos for your wedding?</h2>
<p>Because Samos was where Nik proposed to me and we loved the village where we stayed. Also, Nik comes from Greek Heritage so we thought it would be lovely to get married in Greece. Plus - we love Greece and would go back anytime.</p>
<h2>Was it your first time to Samos? What did you think?</h2>
<p>2nd time in Samos - absolutely love it and we are going back again this year for our wedding anniversary. Samos was just the kinds of quiet and picturesque Greek Island that we love and we liked the fact that the resort we stayed in was unspoilt and had very few tourists - just what we wanted for a relaxing holiday.</p>
<h2>How did you prepare for your wedding in Greece? Was it what you expected?</h2>
<p>As it was just the two of us there was very little to do except buy my wedding dress and give a list of my requirements to Ionian Weddings. Our wedding was exactly what I wanted and more...</p>
<h2>Please describe the most memorable moment from your big day.</h2>
<p>When Nik took my face in his hands and kissed me at the ceremony.</p>
<h2>Is there anything quirky or funny that reminds you of your Greek wedding Experience?</h2>
<p>Our wedding coordinator was amusing and a little eccentric but was thorough, got all the necessary things done for us on time and made us laugh when we went to collect out wedding certificate the day after we got married from the local town hall and fell asleep whilst waiting!!!</p>
<h2>What advice would you give to other brides considering getting married in Greece?</h2>
<p>Do it - you will have the most magical, wonderful and stress free day of your life. Plan exactly what you want for your day and Ionian Weddings will do the rest. From a beach wedding to the town hall you can have you choice of venues and that is what I liked about having the freedom to choose.</p>
<h2>Anything else you would like to add?</h2>
<p>We would like to thank Andreas and Jane for the perfect planning of our special day and to also thank them for making the effort to come to Samos for our wedding as it was the first one they had done on the Island.</p>

<h2>How did you two meet and where did the proposal take place?</h2>
<p>We've been friends since high school, got together after college and have been together about 12 years. We got engaged in Singapore, after Matt surprised me with a holiday and then a proposal, he got down on one knee, it was very romantic, although I was laughing and crying as I hadn't seen it coming!</p>
<h2>Why did you choose Greece and Lefkada for your wedding?</h2>
<p>Once we decided that going abroad was for us and our family were behind the idea, we looked at different destinations and quickly settled on Greece. I'd been to several of the Greek Islands and loved the place, people and climate. We liked the idea of a short haul destination with guaranteed weather so that our family could combine our wedding with a holiday.</p>
<h2>Was it your first time in Lefkada? What did you think?</h2>
<p>Yes it was our first time to Leftkada, but some of our family had been there before and were planning to return so it was highly recommended. And we were not disappointed! It's a beautiful island, not too commercial, idyllic scenery, and stunning beaches with clear water, lots of activities and plenty of places to explore.</p>
<h2>How did you prepare for your wedding in Greece?</h2>
<p>We had discussed getting married abroad a couple of years earlier, but couldn't see how to do it. Then we found Ionian Weddings; and even though we didn't go there before hand, Andreas knowledge of the Greek Islands helped us choose an island that ticked the right boxes for us; beautiful locations, unique ceremony and reception venues, accommodation choices, suitable flights (in half term), avoiding big package destinations. We arranged our holiday and shared options with our family and friends. The relaxed approach suited us and all the finer details from flowers, menu, and colour themes were sorted by our local contact Dora in Nidri. The mayor of the little island Meganissi, which we had chosen for our ceremony even organised a temporary jetty for us!</p>
<h2>Please describe the most memorable part of your day.</h2>
<p>We can't pick one moment, the whole day was amazing! We had spent the night before and day apart, so when we saw each other for the first time at the waterfront it was magical. We met our family and friends there to take a short trip to Meganissi for the ceremony. As a fairly large group in a small town, word spread that we were a wedding party and many locals wished us well throughout the week and gathered to see us off. Dolphins followed alongside the boat and we married outside a chapel under an arch of flowers with the sea just behind us. We returned to Nidri having champagne on the boat and had our reception at a venue just out of town, great Greek food and dancing into the night.</p>
<h2>What advice would you give to other brides considering getting married in Greece?</h2>
<p>Lots of couples say that the big day goes quickly, having our wedding in Lefkada meant that we had a whole week of special moments with our family and friends. There are always those who can't make it wherever you have your wedding, but having the chance to spend so much time with those close to us made it a wonderful, memorable time for those who came. We didn't feel stresses that most couples speak of before a wedding, we left it in Andreas and Dora's capable hands and looked forward to our holiday, finalising wedding day details when we got there. A big thank you to Ionian Weddings for a truly special wedding day and memories that will last all of us a lifetime!</p>

<h2>How did you two meet and where did the proposal take place?</h2>
<p>We have known each other for ever, but started dating (only) 19 years ago. In July 2008 (not a man to rush into anything) Alec decided it was time, and whilst on holiday in Turkey, he got down on one knee, produced a beautiful engagement ring and a year later we were married.</p>
<h2>Why did you choose Greece and Crete for your wedding?</h2>
<p>Our first holiday together was to Zante, where we had the most wonderful time. We have since holidayed on numerous Greek Islands, each unique but all very beautiful. Ionian Weddings have such a choice of wedding venues it was difficult, but in the end the idyllic setting of the lakeside chapel in Agios Nikolaos won us over.</p>
<h2>Was it your first time to Crete? What did you think?</h2>
<p>No we have holidayed in Crete before. Although Crete is one of the larger more commercial Greek Islands, it still holds all of the wonderful scenery, charm and authenticity we love.</p>
<h2>How did you prepare for your wedding in Greece? Was it like you expected?</h2>
<p>We prepared as we would for a wedding at home, but with the prospect of better weather. If we had a query regarding anything, we simply e-mailed Andreas and he supplied suggestions from which we selected our answer. The whole wedding was much more than we expected.</p>
<h2>Please describe the most memorable part of your day.</h2>
<p>It was definitely the setting by the lake where we exchanged our vows, the warm summer air, the background of trees, flowers and little Greek style boats on the lake, it was the most meaningful, emotional and romantic moment of my life. Even Alec had a small tear in his eye.</p>
<h2>Is there anything quirky or funny that reminds you of your Greek Wedding Experience?</h2>
<p>We had eaten at one of the lakeside tavernas several times before our wedding and had told them we were getting married. On the wedding day the owner came out to greet me as I made my way to Alec at the top of the lake. He gave us a Greek blessing which I thought was wonderful.</p>
<h2>What advice would you give to other brides considering getting married in Greece?</h2>
<p>If getting married without stress, hassle and enormous expense sounds good, then take my advice and get married in Greece where you are guaranteed good weather, helpful people and a wonderful holiday thrown in for good measure. What more could you ask?</p>
<h2>Anything else you would like to add?</h2>
<p>I know this is what you expect to read at this point... praise for Ionian Weddings...well that is exactly what you will read, because they thoroughly deserve it. If you want a tailor made wedding which is specific to your needs, then book your wedding with them. They happily sorted all our queries and gave us the most wonderful day which we will always look back on with joy.</p>
