		<h1>Why choose us to plan your big day?</h1>
		<p>Ionian Weddings is an award winning English and Greek specialist consultancy for weddings in Greece with bases in the UK and Greece established by Jane Stuart-Palikira and Andreas Palikiras.  Here is our story...</p><p>Five years ago, we were considering having our wedding in Corfu, Andreas' homeland.  Like many people we had been shocked at the cost of a wedding in the UK.  In addition to huge cost savings, a wedding in the Greek Islands had much to offer: sun, beautiful locations, excellent food and so on.  We searched in vain for a UK-based wedding planner who knew the locations intimately, so we decided to arrange the event ourselves.  Our one nagging fear of guests from the UK being put off by the distance did not materialise as everyone was happy to make the event part of their summer holiday.  The wedding was a wonderful success.</p><p>On our return we decided that we could help others enjoy their own magical wedding in the Greek islands: Jane had more than 10 years experience in the travel industry and a large number of contacts throughout Greece, Andreas had worked for a long time in marketing, we are both Greek speakers and know the Greek culture well.  And so &quot;Ionian Weddings&quot; was born.</p><p>To date we have organised more than 450 memorable weddings in the Greek islands and Cyprus and have won awards for our success.  We are passionate about our weddings and never forget that we are responsible for the most important day of our clients' lives.</p><p>Find out more about our services and why you should choose Ionian Weddings to help you plan your wedding day.</p><p>We are members of the Federation of Small Business (FSB) and supported by the Greek National Tourism Board.</p>
