			<h1>Statement about the Greek economy</h1>
			<h3>01 August 2011</h3>
			<div class="clear"></div>
			<h2>We have had a few enquiries recently about whether the current Greek economic situation will affect any weddings taking place there in the near future</h2>
			<h4>Read more &gt;</h4>
			<div class="clear"></div>
		</div>
		<div class="accordiancontent">
			<div class="maincopy">
				<div class="accordianimage"><img src="images/page/news/i_news_08012011.jpg" alt="" border="0" title="" /></div>
				<p>The simple answer is that we doubt very much you will notice any change. A country in economic difficulties is not like a company or person in the same situation. Even in the worst-case scenario – which would mean Greece defaulting on its sovereign debt (the nation-state equivalent of bankruptcy) – life will carry on. The Greek people's personal circumstances will doubtlessly be adversely affected with higher taxes and public sector cuts (sounds familiar!) but this should not impact visitors.</p>
				<h2>Will it affect my wedding?</h2>
				<p>So far none of our weddings have been affected and we don't anticipate any impact on future weddings. There has been an increase in public demonstrations and strikes, on a similar level to last year when none of our clients were affected. These political demonstrations take place in the centre of major cities such as Athens or Thessaloniki – they will not affect the islands or seaside resorts but sometimes slow the paperwork down due to postal strikes.</p>
				<p>Strikes are always a risk in Greece and we have dealt with many over the years, most of which our customers were unaware had even taken place. They are most likely to affect public sector workers, banks and transport.</p>
				<p>We were recently in Santorini and business was booming, everyone was busy and many saying it was their busiest year ever!</p>
				<p>So we would like to reassure you that Greece is very much open for business and looking forward to welcoming its foreign overseas guests in 2011, 2012 and beyond! The eternals of Greece's huge appeal have not changed - the sun will still shine, the sea will remain blue, local tavernas and shops will be as keen for your custom as ever and everyone involved in your wedding will go out of their way to make it a huge success!</p>

				<h1>Tie the knot at a silver-screen location in Greece</h1>
				<p>For the ultimate dream wedding, choose to exchange vows in a famous film location on a Greek Island and let bespoke wedding planner, Ionian Weddings, work its magic to arrange the most blissful day of your life.</p>
				<p>Jane Palikira, co-founder, Ionian Weddings, says: &quot;When Mamma Mia! was released, there was a huge surge in interest for weddings in Greece and today we still see many couples inspired by the film wanting to get married there. The romance of exchanging vows in a film location, combined with the much lower cost of weddings in Greece or Cyprus compared with the UK – plus, of course, better weather - makes our Greek island destinations the perfect option for a magical day.&quot;</p>
				<p>See below for a few suggestions:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Kefalonia, Captain Corelli's Mandolin – Director John Madden thought nowhere else in the world could replicate the beauty of Kefalonia, where the book is set, and was adamant that the film be shot entirely on the island. Visit Antisami, where Pelagia's village was built from scratch; get married on Myrtos beach, arguably the most beautiful in Greece, or, exclusively for Ionian Weddings' couples only, tie the knot outside the unique 1627-built Assos chapel.</li>
					<li>Amorgos, Big Blue - Luc Besson chose this picturesque island to film the principal scenes of Big Blue and it's easy to see why – deep blue waters, dramatic rocky beaches, silky sands and imposing cliffs set a naturally beautiful scene; perfect for your dream wedding.  With Ionian Weddings, transfer by speedboat from Santorini to Amorgos, exchange vows on the beach and hold your reception overlooking the gorgeous Aegean horizon.</li>
					<li>Skiathos, Mamma Mia! - Located just six miles from the mainland, this lush island is covered in pine forests and boasts 70 sandy beaches. Get married on the small Bourtzi peninsula offering spectacular views and where the Mamma Mia! crew rested under the pine trees in between sets; you can even take a boat-ride in a traditional kaiki boat, similar to the one used by Colin Firth and Pierce Brosnan in the film.</li>
					<li>Mykonos, Shirley Valentine – Ionian Weddings can organise a ceremony in the Manoula Beach Hotel, where much of Shirley Valentine was filmed, or in a traditional windmill in cosmopolitan Little Venice, or on the harbour front in the charming town of Chora, plus many more locations.*</li>
					<li>Corfu, For Your Eyes Only – Achilleion Palace was used for the casino scenes in this Roger Moore classic and the famous beach buggy sequence was filmed on St George's Beach. Car chases took place on the sea-front, near the old Venetian Fort just outside historic Corfu Town; this UNESCO-protected part of Corfu oozes colonial style, neo-classical architecture and Venetian elegance.</li>
					<li>Santorini, Lara Croft Tomb Raider; The Cradle of Life – the sleepy village of Oia on this chic island provided the location for some of the scenes in this film. In addition to clusters of little whitewashed houses, Santorini offers magnificent sunsets, volcanic rock formations, white sands and sparkling waters, making it a wonderfully chic location to tie the knot. Let Ionian Weddings organise a sunset caldera wedding, private beach wedding or a ceremony in a traditional winery.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>For couples considering a Greek island or Cyprus wedding, Ionian Weddings offers a two-hour consultation meeting for a small fee which is fully refundable if the couple makes a booking. Additional services include assistance with booking accommodation for the wedding party and a full documentation service.</p>
				<p>For more information, call the experienced weddings team on <strong>020 8892 7556</strong>.</p>

				<p>Couples now have the unique opportunity to <strong>get married on the fascinating island of Spinalonga</strong> in Elounda, Crete. It's a truly unique place for a wedding in Crete and combines perfectly with a stay in one of Elounda's luxury hotels or in the popular resort of Agios Nikolaos.</p>
				<p><strong>Weddings on Spinalonga</strong> can take place outside the pretty chapel on the island following a private boat transfer from Agios Nikolaos. Alternatively, Ionian couples can choose to take their vows on board with Spinalonga in the background. The cost of this special celebration including the ceremony, decorated car to the port, private boat transfer for all guests, decorations, flowers, photographer &amp; videographer (with photos and dvd), champagne, and reception for 20 guests at a restaurant in Agios Nikolaos comes under £5,000.</p>
				<p>Spinalonga became famous recently as the setting for Victoria Hislop's international bestselling novel <strong>&quot;The Island&quot;</strong> which tells the romantic story of its inhabitants at the time when the island was a leper colony. Offering <strong>weddings on Crete's Spinalonga</strong> is a wonderful celebration of life and heritage as it is indeed one of the most historic lazarettos in the Mediterranean.</p>
				<p><strong>For a limited time only - Every Spinalonga couple gets a FREE copy of &quot;The Island&quot; novel with a personal dedication from Victoria Hislop!</strong></p>
				<p>The island was a Venetian fortress for many years and withstood Turkish attacks when mainland Crete was already occupied, a symbol of independence and perseverance. It was also recently the subject of Channel 4's <strong>&quot;Francesco Da Mosto's Mediterranean Voyage&quot;</strong>, which also featured a <strong>traditional Greek wedding in Crete</strong> with 1,500 guests! Spinalonga has captured the imagination of many writers and visitors from around the world with its stunning rustic buildings and alleys, the castle, its gates and wonderful views of Elounda, Mirabello bay and the open Aegean Sea.</p>
				<p>Couples also have the option of dinner served on their boat and even the possibility of sleeping on board overnight or even hiring the boat exclusively for their honeymoon. Ionian Weddings is currently the only company in the UK to offer <strong>weddings on Spinalonga Island</strong>. If you would like to get married on Spinalonga, please call us on 020 8755 3113 or complete our <a href="?PTID=2" target="_self" title="wedding questionnaire">wedding questionnaire</a>.</p>

				<p>With weddings abroad becoming more and more popular, there is one type of wedding that is more in demand than others: the beach wedding in Greece, especially at this time of year when couples are returning from a holiday in the sun.  What could be more romantic than exchanging your vows on a Greek island with soft sand between your toes and the blue sky and turquoise sea as a backdrop?</p>
				<p>But which beach to choose? We are here to help and have compiled a list of the best beaches in Greece to tie the knot:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Aghios Sostis Island, Zakynthos.  The horseshoe shaped beach on this tiny private island can be hired exclusively for your wedding. The location offers amazing views to the open sea and an opportunity to see the Caretta Caretta loggerhead sea turtle.</li>
					<li>Myrtos, Kefalonia. A large expanse of tiny pure white pebbles and turquoise sea, this is frequently voted one of the most beautiful beaches in the world!</li>
					<li>Marathonissi Island, Zakytnhos. For couples looking for a barefoot beach wedding, this island can only be reached by boat and then wading through the sea for the last few metres. An unforgettable experience for you and your guests.</li>
					<li>Asteras, Meganissi.  Those in the know visit this spectacular beach accessible by boat only. With tiny white pebbles and a backdrop of cliffs, this is a truly spectacular wedding location in the Meganissi fjords and emerald waters.</li>
					<li>Avithos, Kefalonia. Soft yellow sand and a quiet area where you can enjoy privacy.  A nearby taverna overlooking the beach is a perfect reception location for those looking for a Mamma Mia feel.</li>

				<p>Ionian Weddings has launched a special service to help grooms (or brides!) to be to make a wedding proposal their betrothed will never forget in the most romantic parts of the Greek islands.
				<p>Exclusive proposals range from a champagne dinner on a private terrace on Santorini's Caldera watching the world famous sunset to a candlelit meal for two in a cave near Onassis' verdant private island of Skorpios. Complete secrecy is maintained from the unsuspecting loved ones in order to enhance the surprise element and make this special moment a resounding success.</p>
				<p>&quot;We recently arranged a private dinner for two on a secluded beach in Kefalonia with a local mandolin player playing the bride's favourite song (Pelagia's Songfrom Captain Corelli's Mandolin). The bride was completely overwhelmed and needless to say she said yes,&quot; says Andreas Palikiras, Marketing Director at Ionian Weddings. &quot;The couple are now considering returning to the same spot to get married!&quot;</p>
				<p>Ionian Weddings' top spots to propose in the Greek islands include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>A private beach on a secluded island accessible by a wooden bridge across the sea</li>
					<li>Choice of luxury terraces while watching the sunset on Santorini's caldera sipping champagne</li>
					<li>Candlelit dinner inside a cave near Skorpios island or while sailing on turquoise waters</li>
					<li>At the grounds of an illuminated Greek chapel on a tiny private island with spectacular views</li>
					<li>A variety of palaces, stately homes and historic landmarks for a stylish setting</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Wedding celebrations can also be arranged in most of these areas or a location nearby, should the couple choose to return to the same place to exchange their vows.</p>
				<p>&quot;I remember very clearly how stressful it was plucking up the courage to ask the big question, let alone arranging a perfect location and atmosphere&quot; says Andreas.  &quot;Ionian Weddings takes care of everything, allowing the groom-to-be to relax and concentrate on asking the all important question. We can also arrange musicians, fireworks and a professional photographer to capture the moment forever!&quot;</p>
				<p>Prices start from €750 (£650) to include reserving the private area, decorated table and chairs, floral arrangement and candles, local musicians for background music, private waiter, four-course meal with champagne and discreet professional photographer.</p>

				<p>Many couples dream of having a beach wedding abroad - only to discover that because most beaches cannot be hired privately, the reality means sharing your wedding with topless sunbathers and noisy jet skis!</p>
				<p>We have a unique solution to this problem: <strong>exclusive hire of a small island for your wedding in Greece!</strong> This might sound like an expensive option but <strong>wedding couples are amazed to discover it costs from only €1800</strong> (approximately £1,475) and includes hire fees, ceremony, photographer &amp; photos, flowers, champagne and wedding cake. Your dream wedding in Greece will take place in Zakynthos, on the small islet of Cameo.</p>
				<p>The Agios Sostis Island wedding ceremony can be followed by a reception at a traditional Greek taverna complete with Greek music and dancing on the main island of Zakynthos. <strong>The cost, including all the above for the ceremony and a 3-course meal with wine and entertainment is only €3,800</strong> (approx £3,115) for 20 guests. Alternatively, you may choose to extend your stay on the island and have your reception at the stunning terrace upstairs with 180 degree views of the bay, Kalamaki beach and the sunset in the Ionian Sea!</p>
				<p>Agios Sostis Island is set just off the coast of Zante in Greece which is well served by hundreds of weekly direct flights from airports all over the UK in the summer, making it easy for friends and family to join the couple for their wedding day. The island of Zakynthos is also the home of the loggerhead sea turtle Caretta Caretta and famous for one of the most photographed beaches in the Mediterranean – the Shipwreck or Navagio.</p>
				<p>Ionian Weddings offers many other unique wedding ideas on other Greek islands such as a <strong>Kos chapel wedding</strong> on a private island followed by private beach barbecue, a <strong>Lefkada beach wedding inside a cave</strong> and boat reception, a <strong>Santorini beach wedding at the heart of the volcano</strong> or an <strong>ancient temple style venue for your wedding in Crete</strong>.</p>
				<p>The Greek islands are becoming an increasingly popular destination for UK couples marrying abroad as the cost UK weddings is becoming more and more prohibitive for many couples.  Greece is easy to get to from the UK, benefits from simpler legal wedding paperwork than other European countries and English is widely spoken.</p>

			<h1>Hire your own luxury wedding hotel in Greece for less than the cost of a UK venue</h1>

				<p>Ionian Weddings offers couples the opportunity to hire luxurious boutique hotels in the Greek islands on an exclusive basis so they can enjoy the ultimate in privacy and pampering for their wedding day.  A two night stay on an exclusive basis in a boutique hotel in Santorini costs less than £10,000 including breakfast and spa treatments for 60 guests – the same as the basic one day hire of many upmarket venues in the UK.</p>
				<p>&quot;Many couples are amazed to discover that a luxury wedding in Greece costs significantly less than a wedding in the UK.  This means that couples can afford more extravagant weddings that might be impossible to consider back home&quot; says Jane Stuart-Palikira, Managing Director at Ionian Weddings.</p>
				<p>For example, in Santorini, one of the most exclusive islands in Greece, a wedding ceremony and reception at a 5 star hotel overlooking the Caldera costs from £9000 for 60 guests.  This includes hire of the venue for the day, a gourmet 4 course meal with wine and champagne, flowers, photographer, videographer, organization of the ceremony and reception, all local paperwork and a personal wedding planner.  If you then include the hire of the hotel on exclusive basis for 2 nights, the total cost of the wedding is less than £19,000 – less than the average cost of a UK wedding which would not include any accommodation for the guests*.</p>
				<p>&quot;When we told our guests we were marrying in Santorini, they were so excited&quot; said Victoria Nichol who recently celebrated her nuptials with Ionian Weddings on the island. &quot;Many of them came out for the weekend and just had to pay for their flights as we had provided the accommodation for them, others made a week's holiday out of it.  The best thing about it all was that we got to spend a weekend with all our friends and family close by us and could party until the sun rose.  If we'd married back home we would only have seen them for a day and would never have been able to hire a whole hotel.  And of course the weather was much better!&quot;</p>
				<p>*average cost of a UK wedding is £20,000 according to a recent You and Your Wedding survey.</p>

				<p>Ionian Weddings is delighted to add the popular island of Rhodes to its portfolio of wedding islands in Greece, with prices for a Rhodes wedding ceremony in an unforgettable location from only £1095. <strong>Weddings in Rhodes</strong> offer an unrivalled choice of irresistible outdoor wedding locations.  Top of the list is a historic <strong>Lindos wedding</strong> where couples can get married in the grounds of a traditional Greek chapel and are spoilt with not just one but two unforgettable views: the spectacular Lindos Bay and the ancient Acropolis, a UNESCO Heritage site.</p>
				<p>Those looking to exchange their vows in an oasis of calm will love <strong>Kallithea Springs wedding</strong>, an ancient therapeutic site form the 7th century complete with gardens, fountains and Italian 19th Century architecture.</p>
				<p>The wilderness of Filerimos mountain offers a unique wedding location for nature lovers who can tie the knot amongst the thick pines and Cypress tress, with views across the Aegean Sea to Rhodes. <strong>Filerimos weddings</strong> offer a unique setting for those wanting a religious element but a civil wedding.</p>
				<p>And for something unexpected how about a <strong>Faliraki wedding</strong>?  It's famous for its wild parties but what most don't know is that it has one of the prettiest chapels on the island, set in a quiet area of the fishing harbour.</p>
				<p>Wedding ceremonies can also take place on a variety of beaches,  in historic Rhodes Town near where the famous Collosus once stood and at luxury hotels across the island. For the reception, a popular choice is a traditional taverna where guests can dance the night away to Greek music.  Or for those looking for something more sophisticated, a dinner in the grounds of one of the luxury hotels or stylish restaurant with gardens.</p>
				<p>It's easy for friends and family to join in the celebrations as Rhodes benefits from a large number of direct flights from airports all across the UK.</p>
				<p>Ionian Weddings will take care of all the arrangements, from booking the mayor and venue to arranging a Greek band to serenade the bride as she arrives at the wedding venue.  The only thing we can't control is the weather – but with over 300 days of sunshine a year in Rhodes, couples don't even need to worry about that!</p>

				<p>It was recently announced that Mamma Mia was the highest grossing British film ever at the UK box office, overtaking Titanic. And with the DVD proving to be a popular Christmas present, couples are keener than ever to have their own Mamma Mia wedding.</p>

				<p>In some of our featured islands, we have placed the emphasis on the setting and ambience of the Mamma Mia wedding by offering chapels with stunning views and traditional taverna receptions suitably decorated.

				<p>It might seem surprising that weddings abroad are on the increase, with the a huge increase in demand for Greek weddings. However, a wedding in Greece provides the perfect solution for many UK couples for a variety of reasons.</p>
				<p>With the average UK wedding now costing in excess of £18,500*, couples are increasingly looking at alternatives. For example, for just over £2,500, couples can enjoy a Greek island wedding consisting of a memorable beach ceremony and 3-course reception for 20 guests on a terrazza overlooking the Ionian Sea. This price includes all the necessary extras such as champagne, photographer, flowers, wedding cake and arrival by horse and carriage. When you factor in the glorious Greek summer weather and the huge choice of scenic wedding venues including beaches, chapels, gardens, cruise boats and private islands, then a wedding in Greece seems like a dream come true.</p>
				<p>Andreas Palikiras, Marketing Director of Ionian Weddings, the London-based Greek islands wedding specialists, describes how the company has witnessed a 60% increase in wedding bookings for the Greek islands in the last 6 months. &quot;Initially, we were concerned that the credit crunch might adversely affect travel and weddings abroad,&quot; he said, &quot;but we soon noticed that couples were seeing more and more advantages of marrying in Greece&quot;.</p>
				<p>&quot;Many couples, who had originally planned to marry in the UK, are now coming to us because they've witnessed yet another washout British summer, and the cost of a UK wedding spiral out of control. More and more husbands-and-wives-to-be choose to take advantage of the glorious Greek weather and warm hospitality and the prospect of marrying in a choice of beautiful outdoor locations for a fraction of the cost of a UK wedding&quot;.</p>
				<p>The Greek islands are a low-cost destination for holidays, meaning that couples' friends and family can easily join them and enjoy a holiday at the same time – and the newlyweds get to spend more time with them in idyllic surroundings. Greece also benefits from simpler legal wedding paperwork than other European countries, and English is widely spoken.</p>

				<p>Two specialist companies have come together to offer a service that until now has never existed: a headache and hassle-free, tailor-made yet totally unobtrusive means of tying the knot on an idyllic island in Greece.</p>
				<p>Ionian Weddings (IW) is the first wedding consultancy in the UK specialising in Greek island weddings. Greek Islands Club (GIC), a specialist operator with almost 40 years' experience, takes care of all your and your guests' flight arrangements and accommodation in outstanding properties (most with their own private pool) in unspoilt areas.</p>
				<p>Imagine the excitement of your guests when presented with GIC's impressive coffee-table brochure, offering a range of exceptional villas, cottages and town houses for them to choose from.</p>
				<p>Whether it's a bouzouki-serenaded ceremony at an historic town hall, aboard a sailing boat amid azure waters, or barefoot on a beach, your service (be it civil, Anglican, Catholic, Orthodox, a blessing or a renewal of vows) will be tailored to your requirements. Your reception too can be personalised down to the most minute of detail, be it at a traditional beachside taverna, pool-side in the bougainvillea-filled garden of a luxury hotel, or in a chic, open-air restaurant offering the tastiest of modern Greek cuisine. And all this at a fraction of the average cost of a UK-based wedding (currently £18,490*).</p>
				<p>Weddings on the Ionian and Aegean islands can cost from £700 for a simple set-up for two to £7,000 for a lavish ceremony for 80 or more guests. With this in mind it's no wonder couples appreciate exceptional value for money in Greece, as well as its warmth, its impeccable hospitality and its wealth of truly original locations.</p>
				<p>All Ionian Weddings couples that stay at GIC villa receive a welcome pack, a bottle of Greek bubbly and flowers on arrival. And then, to keep it quirky and Greek-centric, speak to them about the possibility of having your wedding on one island and then escaping family and friends by hopping over to another island for your honeymoon!</p>
				<p>For more information contact Ionian Weddings or call Greek Islands Club on 020 8232 9780 / visit <a href="http://www.greekislandsclub.com" target="_blank" title="www.greekislandsclub.com">www.greekislandsclub.com</a>.</p>
