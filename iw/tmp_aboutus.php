		<h1>Andreas & Jane Palikiras,<br />Founders of Ionian Weddings</h1>
		<p>Jane first went to Greece 15 years ago on a business trip and immediately fell in love with the country and its people.  She made contacts all over the country which came in useful when organising her own wedding in Corfu. Jane had 10 years' experience at a senior level in the travel industry before setting up Ionian Weddings and speaks English, Greek, Italian, Spanish & French.  She is on the board of the AWTE (Association of Women Travel Executives) as Events Chair. Jane has visited all the islands featured and specialises in our Cyprus weddings.</p>
		<p><em>"The concept of Ionian Weddings came about when we were planning our own wedding in Corfu.  We wanted to combine the traditional elements of a Greek and an English wedding but all we were offered were pre-set packages which usually involved sharing our special day with other couples.  Frustrated by the casual attitude towards the most important day of our lives, we decided to create our own wedding in Greece which was a huge success and is still talked about by the locals.  I'm really proud that since then we have gone on to organise almost 500 weddings in Greece & Cyprus".</em></p>
		<p>Andreas was born and lived in a small mountain village in Corfu up to the age of eighteen. He originally came to the UK to study at university and has been here ever since although he goes back to his homeland at every opportunity. Upon graduation, Andreas held senior marketing positions before setting up Ionian Weddings with Jane at the start of 2007. He has visited all our venues across the Greek islands and works tirelessly to find new and exciting wedding locations throughout Greece.</p>
		<p><em>"When we started Ionian Weddings, I couldn't have dreamt of being where we are today. Our philosophy of making client aspirations and dreams an affordable reality has made us the obvious choice for bespoke Greek Islands and Cyprus weddings.</em></p>
		<p><em>I particularly enjoy turning a new venue into a unique wedding itinerary that you can't find on the high street. Being Greek definitely helps in negotiating the best for our clients and our glowing testimonials show that we go the extra mile to create perfect and unforgettable weddings."</em></p>

				<h1>Our team: Grace Wilsher<br />Wedding Consultant</h1>
				<p>Grace is one of our specialist Wedding Consultants. Her carreer started in the film industry as an assistant producer.  She has always loved organising projects and bringing everything together to create an impressive final product. After a few years, she decided the film industry wasn't for her. She thought hard as to how she could put her producer's skills to work in a new career.</p>
				<p><em>"When I heard about Ionian Weddings I thought it would be perfect. What better combination could there be? The happiest day of someone's life and the beauty of the Greek Islands! I personally feel like I have a strong connection with Greece, as I spent a considerable amount of time on the Greek Islands growing up, and have many fond memories (marinaded octopus being one of them)!</em></p>
				<p><em>What I love about working for Ionian Weddings is bringing people's visions to life. Every bride pictures what their wedding day is going to be like, and we make it all happen for them! I love the fact  that we guide them through the whole process, from the personal consultation, right up to their big day and everything in between. I'm very proud to work for a such a specialist company with an amazing reputation for creating some of the most beautiful weddings in the Greek Islands."</em></p>
