<h1>About Corfu</h1>
<p>Corfu (Kerkyra in Greek) is the best known of all the Ionian lslands and often cited as the most beautiful island in Greece. Certainly, Corfu has inspired a lot of literature; it was Odysseus' last stop before returning to Ithaca and was described by Homer as a &quot;beautiful and rich land&quot;. It is said to be the setting for Shakespeare's Tempest, and was widely written about by the Durrell brothers, as recalled in the recently BBC televised adaptation of &quot;My Family and Other Animals&quot;.</p>
<p>Old Town of Corfu was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site recently, a wonderful recognition of its unparallel heritage. Its three Venetian forts and neo-classical housing were said to be &quot;a fortified Mediterranean port town of high integrity and authenticity&quot;.</p>
<p>It is the northern-most and second largest of the islands (593 square km) and is often referred to as the &quot;Emerald Island&quot; thanks to its rich vegetation and diverse variety of evergreen cypresses, citrus orchards, grapevines and olive groves.</p>
<p>Like the rest of the Ionian islands, Corfu was fought over by many great civilizations but it is perhaps the Venetians who left the biggest mark on the island. The capital, Corfu Town, has a unique Venetian style to it, with Italian Renaissance buildings and extensive fortifications. The fortresses were built by the Venetians to safeguard their important trade and military base, and were so successful that Corfu was the only one of the Greek islands to withstand Turkish invasions. The two Venetian forts have been well preserved, largely because the British reconstructed them at great expense during their period of colonial rule. The British left another famous mark – Corfu has the only cricket pitch in the whole of Greece!</p>
<p>In addition to a wealth of historic monuments, traditional villages and acres of olive groves, Corfu also offers beautiful beaches, from caves lying on the cusp of the deepest waters in the Mediterranean at Paleokastritsa, to the secluded bays on the east coast and the majestic sand dunes at Issos beach near Corrision Lake.</p>

<h2>Ithaca weddings: marry in the land of Homer's Odyssey</h2>
<p>Ithaca is a unique place to get married.  You can exchange your vows in Ithaca's town hall which has a wonderful setting on the harbour front.</p>
<p>Many couples then choose to travel by boat, serenaded by musicians, to the nearby taverna where the wedding party can be arranged outside overlooking the beach. It is also possible for your wedding or reception to take place in a stylish boutique hotel on the island.</p>

	<li>Wedding in Ithaca's town hall on the harbour front</li>
	<li>Stylish boutique hotel wedding</li>
	<li>Orthodox wedding in a picturesque church</li>
	<li>Ithaca is a wonderful place for a honeymoon, following a wedding in Kefalonia</li>
</ul>
<h1>Ithaca as your wedding destination</h1>
<p>Ithaca is famous in Greek mythology because it is generally thought that Homer's Odyssey was set on this island. It is said that Ithaca either takes its name from Ithacus, son of the sea God Poseidon, or from Ithacis, son of a Kefalonian king who settled there. Ithaca was annexed to Kefalonia during the Byzantine era (395─1185 AD) and the two islands have close historical ties.</p>
<p>With an area of 92.5 square km, Ithaca is the second smallest of the Ionian Islands. It is virtually split into two peninsulas. The northerly peninsula contains the largest villages, the main resorts such as Kioni, a village set in a horseshoe-shaped bay which is popular with yachters, plus a few smaller resorts and some spectacular walks. The South boasts the settings for Homer's Odyssey (you can visit Eumais' cave and Arethusa's spring), and the capital Vathy (meaning &qout;deep&quot;) has one of the most picturesque seafront settings in all of Greece. Like the rest of the Ionian Islands, Ithaca is covered in olive groves, with many cypresses and also orchards of orange,<br />
	lemon, fig and pear trees.</p>
<p>Ithaca is surrounded by pristine turquoise sea and white beaches (made from tiny smooth white pebbles). Many of its beaches can only be reached by boat, offering visitors the luxury of private swimming and bathing. Although popular, the island is hardly touched by tourism and benefits from strict regulations that require all new buildings be built in harmony with existing architecture. As a result, there are no large hotel complexes, and it really is possible to experience the authenticity of the Ionian islands in its purest form.</p>

</ul>
<h1>About Kefalonia</h1>
<p>Romantic Kefalonia is the largest of the Ionian Islands (904 square km). It is famous for its dramatic mountain range (the third largest in Greece) and its unique breed of wild &quot;Ainos&quot; ponies, named after the highest point on the island.</p>
<p>It also boasts underwater caves such as those at Melissani and Drogarati, quaint fishing villages, beautiful beaches and hundreds of different species of wildflower. Your wedding in Kefalonia will be truly unforgettable.</p>
<p>Kefalonia is said to take its name from an ancient king, Kefalos, who ruled the area during the Paleolithic era. Like the other islands, it was invaded by a succession of Romans, Turks, Spanish and Venetians, French and English.  During World War II, the island was occupied by the Italians, and in 1953 experienced a dramatic earthquake. Both of these events are covered in Louis de Berniere's novel, Captain Corelli's Mandolin. The eponymous Hollywood film of the story was shot entirely on the island. You can follow the steps of the sreen stars with your wedding in Kefalonia, by heading towards Antisami, where Pelagia's village was completely built from scratch.</p>
<p>Kefalonia's highlights are many and varied. There is the quaint fishing village of Fiskardo, which was untouched by the earthquake and is very popular with the yachting fraternity. Myrtos, a spectacular beach within a stunning circular cove is often voted the most beautiful beach in Greece - travellers have said they would cross the world just to swim there. Assos, a beautiful bay with traditional tavernas nestling in the shadow of an enormous pine-covered rock, boasts the ruins of a Venetian fortress.</p>

<h2>Lefkas weddings: marry on the beach or on a boat near Onassis' island</h2>
<p>Lefkada is popular choice for couples looking for a wedding on a less developed Greek island.</p>
<p>Most weddings take place in Nidri, the main resort on the island, and the sandy beach is a popular choice for a relaxed and simple wedding. For something truly unique, it is possible to arrange a wedding on a boat in the Nidri archipelago with Skorpios island in the background.</p>
<p>Nidri offers a good selection of tavernas where the reception can be held afterwards.</p>
<p>An alternative is for the wedding to take place on nearby Meganissi, an island next to Lefkada which can be reached in 20 minutes by boat.</p>

	<li>Wedding on Meganissi Island</li>
	<li>Orthodox wedding in picturesque churches all over the island</li>
</ul>
<h1>Lefkada as your wedding destination</h1>
<p>Lefkada means &quot;whiteness&quot; in Greek and takes its name from the white limestone cliffs on the Southern Cape Kefkatas, which is where the ancient Greek poet Sappho is said to have leapt to her death when the young boatman Phaon rejected her love.</p>
<p>Lefkada was once connected to mainland Greece but the Corinthians dug a channel in order to separate it from the mainland.</p>
<p>Today it is connected to mainland Greece by a 50m floating bridge, making it easy to reach the airport of Preveza, which is only 30 minutes away on the mainland. Lefkada is 302 square km in size, making it the fourth largest Ionian island. However, the &quot;island&quot; is actually an archipelago, made up of 24 small and large islands. You can take a boat to the many of these, including the tiny island of Skorpios on the east side of Lefkada, home to the Onassis family.</p>
<p>The rugged west coast boasts outstanding and often deserted stretches of white beaches, which are a contrast to the mountains of the interior and the gentle green countryside of the east coast. There are a few developed resorts such as Nidri (popular with yachts) and Vassiliki (one of the world's top windsurfing spots), but the island's charm lies in its many small traditional villages. These have changed little over the years and present a wonderful opportunity to see Greece at its most original.</p>

Among the many attractions are several fishing villages, the most spectacular of which is Lakka, while the absence of an airport connecting it with other tourist destinations means that much of the island is still relatively untouched.</p>

<h1>About the island of Zante (Zakynthos)</h1>
<p>Greek mythology has it that Zakynthos was named after the son of Dadanus (King of Troy), who set sail from the Arcadian city of Psofida and founded his acropolis on this island to remind him of his homeland. Zakynthos is the southernmost of the Ionian Islands, 13.5 km south of Kefalonia and 15.2 km east of the Greek mainland.</p>
<p>It is the 3rd largest in size (406 square km) It boasts beautiful beaches; those on the north, east and south coasts are easily reached whilst those on the west coast are the most spectacular and only accessible by boat. This area includes the famous Blue Caves, named for the colour of the water in the deepest hollows.</p>
<p>Zakynthos is known in Greece as the island of song and poetry. It is thought that the god of Music, Apollo, was worshipped here, and the serenades and folk songs for which Zakynthos is famed are still an important part of the culture. The island  also has many monasteries, where you can hear the mysterious and unique Zakynthian chants. Zakynthos was the home of Dionysios Solomos, Greek national poet and writer of the Greek national anthem!</p>
<p>Another Zakynthian highlight is the abundance of flora and fauna.  The high rainfall in the winter means that a wide range of rare flowers and plants thrives here. The island is perhaps most famous for Caretta caretta (the loggerhead turtle) which lays its eggs on the southern shore of the island. This reptile is an endangered species and the Greek government has created a marine park in Laganas Bay to safeguard the loggerhead colonies and inform visitors about this national treasure. Also protected is Monachus monachus (the Mediterranean monk seal), which can be found on the western coast.</p>
