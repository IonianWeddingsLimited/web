		<h1>Booking Terms and Conditions</h1>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<h1>CONTRACT:</h1>
				Please read these booking conditions carefully as they, together with the useful information and the specific information about your confirmed wedding arrangements, form the basis of your contract with Ionian Weddings Limited. Your contract with Ionian Weddings Limited will be binding once our booking confirmation is issued.</li>
			<li>
				<h1>PRICES:</h1>
				We reserve the right to alter any of our advertised wedding prices up to the date of confirmation of your booking. You will be advised of the current price of the wedding arrangements that you wish to book before your contract is confirmed. When booking more than a year in advance the prices indicated are approximate and cannot be confirmed until our suppliers have set their rates for the year in question. We will provide you with an estimate and confirm the prices prior to the prices being finalised and notified to you prior to your wedding.<br />
				<br />
				All monies you pay to your Travel Agent are held by them on behalf of Ionian Weddings Limited at all times.<br />
				<br />
				The price of your wedding package will be calculated using exchange rates quoted by the Co-operative Bank on the date of confirmation in relation to the following currencies: € and £GBP. You have the option to pay the price of your wedding package in Euros or GBP Sterling.<br />
				<br />
				It is unlikely that the price of your wedding arrangements will change after confirmation of the final price however this may be necessary where changes in local taxes or fees for any of the wedding arrangements are invoked and which we have no control over. However we will ensure that there is no change within one month of your wedding date. In the unlikely event of a change in price, we will advise you in advance and provide you with the option of cancelling and receiving a full refund of all monies paid, with the exception of any administration fees or you may continue with the arrangements and pay the difference in price.<br />
				<br />
				We do all we can to ensure prices quoted on our website are correct when entered on to our systems however in rare cases errors may incur. We regret that any contract entered into on the basis of an erroneous price will be void. In the unlikely event that this arises, we will give you the option to either pay the correct price or cancel with a full refund.</li>
			<li>
				<h1>MAKING A BOOKING AND PAYMENT:</h1>
				When you have chosen your wedding arrangements and you make a request to us to book it, you must pay a deposit of €600 if wedding ceremony only or €800 if you are also booking a wedding reception. There are other wedding packages that carry a larger deposit fee which we will inform you of prior to booking. Your booking is confirmed and a contract between us exists when we issue our confirmation email. Please check your confirmation carefully and report any incorrect or incomplete information to us immediately. Please ensure that names are exactly as stated in the relevant passport. If you have paid a deposit, the balance of the cost of your wedding arrangements is due 90 days before the wedding date. If it is not received in time we will remind you that it is overdue. If you fail to pay within 7 days of receipt of the reminder we will cancel your booking and retain your deposit. Payments by U.K credit card will attract a credit card charge of 2%, and 3% for International credit cards.</li>
			<li>
				<h1>YOUR RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR BOOKING:</h1>
				When you make a booking you guarantee that you have the authority to accept and do accept on behalf of your party the terms of these booking conditions. This means that you are responsible for making all payments due, notifying us if any changes or cancellations are required and for receiving the confirmation and keeping your party informed. Unfortunately we are not able to accept any bookings for wedding arrangements where the intended couple is under 18 years of age.</li>
			<li>
				<h1>INSURANCE:</h1>
				It is your responsibility to ensure that you are adequately insured. We strongly recommend that you take out insurance, which should include cover against the cost of cancellation by you and assistance (including repatriation) in the event of accident or illness.</li>
			<li>
				<h1>IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE YOUR BOOKING:</h1>
				After our confirmation has been issued, any requests for changes must be sent to us in writing, by email, fax or post, by the person that made the booking or your travel agent. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to accommodate your request but we will try to do so. You will be asked to pay an administration fee plus any charge made by the relevant supplier. Full details of the applicable administration fees are indicated below. These are likely to be higher the closer you get to your wedding date, so please ensure you contact us as soon as you can if you know you will have to make a change. If you change the number in your party, the wedding arrangements price will be re-calculated. If the party size is reduced, this is likely to mean the remaining members paying more due to your original arrangements being made for a larger party.<br />
				<br />
				Administration fees:
				<ul>
					<li>Change of name after deposit paid: £50</li>
					<li>Change of date after deposit paid: £100 (plus any fee levied by venue)</li>
					<li>Change of venue after deposit paid: £200 (plus any fee levied by venue). NOTE: If you book a reception with Ionian Weddings Limited and subsequently choose not to proceed with it, the cancellation fee will be £300.</li>
					<li>Adding and removing guests, items or services to wedding package after final payment has been made: £50 administration fee per guest, item or service. Please note: if you are adding a guest to your package then you will be required to pay the £50 administration fee in addition to the price of your added guest(s).</li>

				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h1>IF YOU WANT TO CANCEL YOUR BOOKING:</h1>
				The person that made the booking or your agent must put this in writing to us, by email, fax or post quoting your booking reference. Because we incur costs in cancelling confirmed bookings, particularly if cancellations occur close to arrival date, you will be charged a cancellation fee.<br />
				<br />
				Cancellation fees: If you cancel (this is the date on which we receive your written notice of cancellation during the hours of 9am to 5.30pm):<br />
				<ul>
					<li>More than 3 months before your wedding: deposit will be lost</li>
					<li>Less than 3 months before your wedding, full payment will be lost</li>
				</ul>
			<li>
				<h1>IF WE CHANGE OR CANCEL YOUR BOOKING:</h1>
				It is unlikely that we will have to make any changes to your wedding arrangements, however, as your arrangements are usually planned months in advance, on occasion we may be forced to make changes and we reserve the right to change or cancel your booking at any time if necessary. Most changes will be minor and we will advise you (or your travel agent) as soon as we are aware of any changes. Subject to the note below, if we make a change and you don't want to accept it, you can accept any alternative wedding arrangements we are able to offer you (you will pay the increase in cost if the replacement is advertised at a higher price than your original booking, or receive a refund of the difference if it is less expensive) or a refund of the money you've paid to us. This does not apply where the change is not material. Examples of non-material changes include, but are not limited to, temporary withdrawal of facilities or seasonal unavailability of amenities. Subject to the note below, if we have to cancel, again we may be able to offer you an alternative. If you accept it, you would pay the difference if it was advertised at a higher price than your original wedding arrangements, or receive a refund of the difference if it was advertised at a lower price. Or we will refund the monies you have paid us for your wedding arrangements. We will not be responsible to pay any compensation following a change or a cancellation by us. Any amendment or cancellation fees you incur in terms of other arrangements you have made with other providers under separate contracts are not claimable from us. Note: If a change or cancellation occurs because of circumstances beyond our control, for example war, riot, industrial dispute, actual or threatened terrorist activity and its consequences, natural or nuclear disaster, fire, adverse weather conditions, flood, epidemic or pandemic illness and all similar situations we will have no liability to you. No compensation, costs, expenses or any other sums, including the cost of securing alternative wedding arrangements will be paid by us.</li>
			<li>
				<h1>OUR RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR BOOKING:</h1>
				i. We have a duty to select the wedding arrangements providers with reasonable skill and care. We have no liability to you for the actual provision of the wedding arrangements, except in cases where it is proved that we have breached that duty and damage to you has been caused. Therefore, providing we have selected the provider with reasonable care and skill, we will have no liability to you for anything that happens pre or post your wedding or any acts or omissions of the wedding provider (or supplier) or others. Similarly, we will not incur any liability in the following situations: where the wedding arrangements cannot be provided as booked due to circumstances beyond our control not limited to but including the circumstances in clause 8 and in cases of injury or illness through no fault of our own and your wedding arrangements must be rearranged as a result.<br />
				<br />
				ii. where you incur any loss or damage that could not have been foreseen at the time of your booking, based on the information provided by you.<br />
				<br />
				iii. where you incur any loss or damage that relates to any business activity.<br />
				<br />
				iv. where any loss or damage relates to any services which do not form part of our contract with you.<br />
				<br />
				If we are found liable to you on any basis, we limit the amount we have to pay you to a maximum of three times the cost of your wedding arrangements. This limit does not apply to cases involving death or injury.</li>
			<li>
				<h1>BEHAVIOUR:</h1>
				When you book wedding arrangements through us, you accept responsibility for the proper conduct of all members of your party in respect of your wedding arrangements. The wedding venue reserves the right at any time to terminate the wedding arrangements if any member of the party's behaviour is such, in the reasonable opinion of the wedding supplier or us, as to cause or to be likely to cause danger, upset or distress to anyone else or damage to property. Full cancellation charges will then apply and no refund will be given. Furthermore, we shall be under no obligation whatsoever to pay compensation or meet any costs or expenses (including but not limited to alternative wedding arrangements) you may incur as a result of your wedding being terminated. If you cause damage to the wedding venue, you must fully reimburse the wedding supplier provider concerned for the cost of the damage before the end of your stay if the cost has been established by then or as soon as it has been established if later. You must also indemnify us for the full amount of any claim (including all legal costs) made against us by the wedding supplier or any third party as a result.</li>
			<li>
				<h1>ACCOMMODATION ONLY BOOKINGS:</h1>
				We occasionally offer hotels or apartments on an 'accommodation only' basis. If you make a booking with us for 'accommodation only' we will act as agent for the hotel or apartment supplier unless stated otherwise. In respect of your accommodation arrangements, the terms and conditions of the relevant supplier will apply and will be made available to you at the time of booking. We will not be liable for any claims in accordance with your accommodation only booking and any concerns or claims should be raised directly with the supplier in question.</li>
			<li>
				<h1>COMPLAINTS:</h1>
				If you have a problem in relation to your wedding whilst in resort, please inform the wedding supplier and our wedding co-ordinator immediately, who will endeavour to put things right. You should also try to find a solution whilst you're there. If your complaint is not resolved locally, please follow this up within 28 days of your return home by writing to our Customer Services Department at 9 Prado Path, Twickenham, TW1 4BB giving your booking reference and all other relevant information. Please keep your letter concise and to the point. This will assist us to identify your concerns quickly and speed up our response to you. If you fail to follow this simple procedure we will have been deprived of the opportunity to investigate and rectify your complaint whilst you were in resort and this may affect your rights under this contract. Any dispute or claim arising out of this contract that cannot be settled between us can be referred by you to ABTA arbitration (see clause 14) or court. We agree that the courts of England and Wales have jurisdiction and English law applies (unless you live in Scotland or Northern Ireland, in which case you can bring proceedings in your local court under Scots or Northern Irish law, as applicable.)</li>
			<li>
				<h1>FINANCIAL PROTECTION:</h1>
				The monies you pay to us for your wedding arrangements are protected by means of a bond held by ABTA. This means that, if in the unlikely event of our insolvency your wedding arrangements can't be provided, you will receive your money back or, if your stay has started, arrangements will be made for you to be able to continue as planned.</li>
			<li>
				<h1>ABTA:</h1>
				We are a Member of ABTA, membership numbers P0174 and Y4786. We are obliged to maintain a high standard of service to you by ABTA's Code of Conduct. We can also offer you an arbitration scheme for the resolution of disputes arising out of, or in connection with this contract. The arbitration scheme is arranged by ABTA and administered independently. It provides for a simple and inexpensive method of arbitration on documents alone with restricted liability on you in respect of costs. The scheme does not apply to claims for an amount greater than £5,000 per person. There is also a limit of £25,000 per booking form. Neither does it apply to claims which are solely in respect of physical injury or illness or their consequences. The scheme can however deal with compensation claims which include an element of minor injury or illness subject to a limit of £1,500 on the amount the arbitrator can award per person in respect of this element. Your request for arbitration must be received by ABTA within eighteen months of the date of return from holiday. Outside this time limit arbitration under the Scheme may still be available if we agree, but the ABTA Code does not require such agreement. For injury and illness claims, you can request the ABTA Mediation Procedure and we have the option to agree to mediation. Further information on the Code and ABTA's assistance in resolving disputes can be found on www.abta.com.</li>

Please note that the price of each document is subject to charges set by third parties i.e. local authorities and we reserve the right to implement and notify you of any price changes in advance of your wedding which will be payable in full. All documents supplied to us must: be of good quality and free of errors or spelling mistakes. In addition the documents must be suitable for the purpose intended and delivered in such format as requested and in the time specified.

				We will arrange to provide the facilities and services as advertised on our website. However, if we or our suppliers withdraw such facilities or services or limit them for any reason, we will seek to advise you in advance. It is common for facilities to be unavailable outside of peak season in various resorts or for them to be less widely available during quieter periods; in such circumstances we cannot accept any liability. There may be occasions (particularly at the beginning or end of a season) where suppliers decide to close venues or facilities early due to a lack of bookings. In the event this occurs, we will endeavour to source an alternative venue of the same standard but you will be liable to pay any increase in cost. If you choose not to accept any alternative offered you will be free to cancel your booking and obtain a full refund.</li>

It is impossible to foresee the extent of any building activity and whilst we will try to do so, we cannot guarantee that we will be in a position to issue information on any changes in local conditions. Where we are made aware of such building work and if in our opinion it is likely to affect your wedding, we will endeavour to notify you as soon as possible.
