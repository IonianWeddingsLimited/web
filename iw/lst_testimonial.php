					<p>Hi Andreas,</p>

We feel sorry for the next group of friends to get married as it won't be a patch on ours. We have so many wonderful memories - and photos, a couple of which are enclosed. Wishing you every success for the future.</p>

					<p><strong>Samantha &amp; Dale , Kallithea Springs, Rhodes, September 2011</strong></p>
					<p>Your pre-wedding service was excellent. I had dozens of questions but you answered them patiently and quickly. We had a brilliant day. Kallithea Spa was a unique and special place for us to get married and I am really glad we chose it instead of a beach wedding. There was a great atmosphere in Rhodes Old Town at the reception too.</p>
					<p>Ionian Weddings were very helpful when we were trying to pick a location and gave practical advice. I was so worried about having a "conveyor belt" wedding but Jane totally put my mind at ease. The great thing about getting married abroad is that someone else can do the worrying for you! But don't be afraid to ask questions. I felt excited and stress free on our flight to Rhodes because I knew what to expect and that was thanks to Ionian Weddings.</p>

					<p><strong>Wendy &amp; Jayson, Agios Sostis, Zakynthos, September 2011</strong></p>
					<p>Hi,</p>
					<p>I just wanted to say on behalf of Jayson and myself a very big thank you for such wonderful wedding you arranged for us on Cameo Island Zante. Everything was perfect and better than we could ever have expected, all our guests had a fantastic time too and your team over there were very helpful too. We certainly had the perfect wedding and was worth every penny.. We had decided that we wanted a beach wedding in Zante and loved the idea of Cameo Island. It was perfect on the Island, the setting was fantastic. The team over on Zante were very helpful and couldn't do enough for you. All in all we had the perfect day, better than our expectations. We wanted our reception at our favourite taverna so we went for the ceremony only package and that was great, the flowers were lovely and the photographer was fantastic, it was extremely hot on the day and he worked very hard.</p>

					<p><strong>Leanne &amp; Alexander, Pantheon, Santorini, September 2011</strong></p>
					<p>I would say that getting married overseas and using Ionian Weddings is the best way to go. It was so easy and stress free. I was concerned that when we arrived in Santorini, things would not be as I imagined.....but they were better!! The venue, food, flowers, cake &amp; wedding planner were all superb! Jane kept us fully up to date before flying out to Santorini. Sophia who met us out in Santorini was lovely and a great help. Sophia escorted us around the island to pick the flowers and the cake and everything is explained fully to you both before the big day. I woud also recommend doing the paper work with Ionian Weddings. Our wedding day was so stress free, but also the most gorgeous day you could hope for!</p>

					<p><strong>Joanne &amp; Russell, Georgoupolis, Crete, September 2011</strong></p>
					<p>Once we had decided to get married in Crete, I did some research on the internet and Ionian Weddings always stood out for me. Since getting in touch, Andreas has been fantastic all the way through giving me all the information that I needed, put me at ease when under pressure and putting up with me when I changed my mind several times and responded to all my e mails. The location that I chose was Georgoupolis Chapel by the sea, fantastic location and the day was amazing, much more than I had dreamt of. I had a makeup and hairdresser come to my hotel and she was lovely, did a fantastic job and had a driver who picked me up from the hotel which was also excellent. Our wedding coordinator was fantastic, did all that we asked of him and much more . Overall a fantastic service.</p>

					<p><strong>Nicola &amp; Steve, Assos Chapel, Kefalonia, August 2011</strong></p>
					<p>A perfect day! The ceremony at Assos was stunning. We had an expectation of how we wanted things to look but when we first walked round that corner to see the set up it was beyond our expectations and couldn't have been more perfect. The reception venue was first class. We hadn't seen the location or venue first hand until we arrived in Kefalonia but you'd do well to better it anywhere in the world. Some of the photos of the speeches with the sun going down over the mountains and sea behind us are spectacular. Food was amazing; staff were attentive, venue set up just as we asked and a fantastic relaxed atmosphere. We cannot speak highly enough of our wedding planner who was attentive from our first meeting until the wedding and always available to talk or meet. Everything we hadn't thought of , she had and she filled in all of the blanks to make every part of our day perfect. I would not hesitate in recommending Ionian Weddings and Kefalonia. Thanks again.</p>

					<p><strong>Margie &amp; Andrew, St Irene, Santorini, August 2011</strong></p>
					<p>What an amazing location St Irene is for a wedding location. No words can describe how our day went. Getting married at 6 pm was the best time to marry as the sun is shining for your photographs and if you travel up the island to have more photographs taken you get the sunset. The wedding car was lovely, a black Mercedez and the flowers were outstanding. I selected the flower colour to be burgundy but left the florist to decide on the flowers and the design. I loved them and all the guests commented on how beautiful they are. The wedding planner in resort was lovely and nothing was too much trouble. She even explained to our guests about the tradition of honey and rice which again out guests took great delight in throwing at Andy and I !!!! Ouch ! The wedding album and video is a must. Book the Gold Package, well worth having the extras like hair and makeup.</p>

					<p><strong>Taya &amp; Martyn, St Irene, Santorini, August 2011</strong></p>
					<p>First of all thank you for all your help over the last two years. We have been home now for 6 weeks and are missing the beautiful sights of Santorini. Our wedding day was fantastic and we thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it, so did our guests. Without your help it wouldn't have had such a great success, so thank you. Furthermore, I would personally like to thank Jane for answering all my e mails especially when she was on maternity leave, something which I understand to be a really challenging time in life.</p>
					<p>The ceremony at St Irene was breath taking, and couldn't have been more perfect. The registrar did make us laugh a little which helped me as I was quite nervous. Our reception was beautiful and looked exactly how we wanted it. Nikos was very thorough and met us prior to the wedding to go through all the plans for the day. After meeting our wedding planner we felt so relaxed due to her professionalism and so excited that all our ideas were possible. The food was fantastic and we couldn't praise the Chef enough.</p>
					<p>As the bride I was very nervous about my hair and the bridesmaids, as well as the photography, however they did a great job and the results were beautiful. We loved receiving our wedding photos the day before going home as it brought back all the great memories of the wedding day.</p>
					<p>Once again thank you so much for all your hard work. I hope you have a good year and good luck with future weddings.</p>

					<p>Ionian Weddings helped to make our wedding day everything we had hoped for. Booking was so easy! It was waiting for the 12 months to pass that was the hard part !We really appreciated the help with the paperwork, again another stress taken off our hands! If we could go back and do it all again we would not change one thing - it was perfect and how many couples can say that? The coordinator in Skaithos was wonderful, making all the final legalities and formalities so easy and laid back. there truly was no stress at all ! The flowers were perfect and the photographer was excellent. He really directed us to get the best possible pictures! Our friends and family that came said it was the best wedding that they had ever been to. The wedding album really captures the party atmosphere of the day and we genuinely smiled and laughed all day! The boat trip was a last minute surprise for our guests and made the day totally wonderful and chilled. Amazing time had by all - Thank you so much !</p>

					<p>Ionian Weddings were brilliant at organising all of the details of our wedding; nothing was too much hassle and I can honestly say my wedding was entirely stress free (not many brides can say that !) Our wedding planner was super organised in Kefalonia and I was amazed at how much time and effort was spent getting everything right. The food was wonderful and the whole process was super smoothly run. Ionian Weddings gave us a perfect wedding at half the price of a wedding at home and all our guests said how beautiful it was!

					<p>Weddings are always a stressful time and you put a lot of faith in people that you have never met. Thw whole experience was fantastic and the wedding went without a hitch. We cannot thank Ionian Weddings enough for all the hard work that they did in England and also in Greece.

It was an amazing day, both for them and for all who shared it with them. It was really great to have the wedding planners support throughout the proceedings which out us all at our ease.</p>
					<p>The setting at Santo Winery was just perfect for the marriage and I'm sure that the proof of this will be more than apparent in the photographs. The reception at the Pyrgos was brilliant.

					<p><strong>Charlotte &amp; Christopher, St Irene, Santorini, July 2011</strong></p>
					<p>We married in Santorini, St Irene's, in July 2011. We had the most fantastic time, almost everything was pre-organised prior to us flying out there and upon our arrival there the wedding planner (very very nice and helpful) helped us with last minute details, such as picking the flowers and flavour of cake etc. The vanilla sponge with actual strawberries and icing was the BEST cake I had ever tasted! The whole process was virtually stress free. The ceremony had stunning views and was totally perfect, there was a nice breeze so the heat doesn't affect your makeup/dress etc....as much as you'd think. The reception venue could not have been better. The manager was great and we even got to go down for wine tasting a few days before so we could choose our wines/champagnes. The food was faultless and the service the same. The reception venue stayed open as long as we were there and were very tolerant in letting us play our own selection of (very interesting) music! We even left with a bottle of champers and some strawberries for our wedding night. All in all a perfect day, perfect location and is definitely the way to do it. Thanks for all the help. We would recommend your services to anyone who will listen!</p>

Our wedding coordinator was absolutely wonderful and so helpful with every detail. One bit of advice we would give to other couples is to put your trust in the team in Zante.

					<p>A big THANK YOU to Ionian Weddings for organising our fantastic wedding. We got married in Zante. Our wedding planner and all the staff were really well organised. I did not get married until 6.30pm - I was shopping on the morning of the wedding and my husband was still in the swimming pool at 3.30pm because everything was so organised. The wedding was perfect and very emotional. The decorations ,flowers, DJ and cake were amazing!!! the photgraphs are out of this world. The Greek dancing and the fireworks made the wedding different to other weddings and added a special touch. All 46 guests, thought it was the best wedding they had ever been to. We had a big party when we got back home where we had a beach theme and Greek dancing with photographs of the wedding being played on a big projector. We cannot wait until we get our video so we can go through our wedding day again! We are planning a Greek theme night and inviting our friends and family to watch our video. Thank you again.

We were also lucky enough to get an excellent photographer on that day and we were a couple that really understood what a beach wedding should be about, no wedding dresses as such.

For those of you out there that are unsure about the whole booking a wedding and not having any real control over the organisation of it, I would say don't worry, everything will be perfect! Flowers, hair, decorations they will all be amazing!!!! Ours were. There was nothing I could have moaned about at all. We got married o Agios Sostis Island and the wedding planner had everything in hand and ensured smooth running on the day! The hairdresser couldn't have been nicer and did a perfect job with my hair. Ionian Weddings have been great for us, they respond to all e mails (and there were a lot!), took phone calls and generally helped us out with any of our questions that we had. My recommendation to you all - get married through Ionian Weddings!!!</p>

					<p><strong>Debbie &amp; Grant, Corfu Town Hall, Corfu, July 2011</strong></p>
					<p>We would definately recommend getting married in Corfu, it's beautiful!  Our wedding coordinator there was brilliant and so well organised that we were able to relax and enjoy our holiday without any worries and carried out a wonderful blessing ceremony on the beach of our choice. The flowers and car were perfect, and and our reception was fantastic - the setting, the service, the music and especially the food was excellent and enjoyed by everyone. The photographer was great and we were able to pick up our album 2 days after the wedding, so had our pics to show off as soon as we got home! Thanks for making our wedding so memorable, just wish we could do it all again!</p>

					<p>The chapel setting above Assos, overlooking the sea, was idyllic, peaceful and beautiful, and we would recommend it to anyone. The Ionian Wedding staff could not have been more helpful and friendly, and made the wedding a relaxing and perfect day. The mandolin player was an essential!</p>

					<p><strong>Claire &amp; Richard, La Maltese, Santorini, June 2011</strong></p>
					<p>Having holidayed in Santorini, and we felt more comfortable dealing with a reputable Uk-based company and Ionian Weddings were local to us, which is why we chose to use their services. Andreas was very personable and easy to deal with and for those Uk couples who need a lot of help and direction in planning their wedding, I would recommend using Ionian Weddings. Andreas secured the most amazing venue for us, which we wouldn't have found without him. Personally we enjoyed arranging many of the services down to personal preference and we found a good balance and it was good to know that we had the support of Ionian Weddings ; having their coordinator on hand in Santorini made everything run smoothly, and ended in the most magical and memorable wedding day!</p>

					<p><strong>Done &amp; Andre, Agios Sostis, Zakynthos, June 2011</strong></p>
					<p>Wow ! Where do we start?? From the moment we met Andreas at his offices, we felt very confident that our wedding was in good hands with his extensive knowledge of the island. When we did a recky and met our wedding planner, we felt even more relaxed and excited. Nothing was ever too much trouble, even replying to my hundreds of e mails, always done with a smiley face!! Everything was better than I could ever have dreamt of. The relaxed style of the florists, caterers, musicians and even Ionian Weddings, sometimes made me concerned as it is so different to experiences with British caterers, florists etc. But they are so true to their word and treat your wedding day as if they were organising for a close friend! I want to do it all again! Vows renewal!!?? too soon?? Ready for another load of e mails Andreas? Thanks a million! From a very over the moon Mr &amp; Mrs Viljoen :-)</p>

					<p><strong>Anne &amp; Bob, Pythagorio Town Hall, Samos, June 2011</strong></p>
					<p>Anne and I have been together for 18 years and only wanted a simple wedding with our 2 friends. Consequently I didn't expect much from Ionian Weddings but we couldn't have been better looked after by their Samos coordinator. She performed miracles and by the time we got to the Mayors office we thought of her more as a friend.  We had a week in Chios but we asked for a church blessing on our return. Not an easy thing for two divorcees who are not Greek Orthodox but she managed it , and it only cost us a bottle of wine!!!!!</p>

					<p>The Island of Kefalonia, the wedding and 45 guests were amazing. We decided on the chapel at Assos and we were not disappointed, it was magical with a view to die for. We followed on back to the taverna on the beach front, perfect for the 15 guests under the age of 8! The food was lovely and the owner could not have done more to help and make our reception just wonderful. From beginning to end our planners were fantastic, extremely helpful and supervised the wedding to a tee! Thank you . It truly was more than I could have wished for.</p>

					<p>Been home two days now and would just like to say efharisto (hope i spelt it right) everything was brilliant, the Greek people were very kind did not realise they were so nice! There's not a lot i can say to improve, everything done was perfect for us, could not be happier, would recommend Ionian Weddings to anyone. The wedding co-ordinator once we arrived was excellent, every detail seemed to be very important, even though our wedding was so small they arranged everything as if it was massive, flowers were fresh and the car was on time and beautifully clean and decorated, and the next morning we were picked up and took for our photo album, all first class treatment!</p>

Our coordinator did a brilliant job the photographer was amazing to work with.

					<p>Our Cameo Island wedding was the best day of our lives and exceeded all our expectations. The location was magical and the organisation perfect. No little touch was forgotten, from the music and decorations to seating plans and flowers. It all ran so smoothly and so we were left just to enjoy the day. I would recommend a Greek wedding to any couple wanting a unique and special day with a lot less stress than a UK wedding. Without Ionian weddings and the planner in Zante, none of this would have been possible.</p>

					<p>I&rsquo;m so pleased we booked with Ionian Weddings. Everything about our wedding was perfect. We had no stress or worries at all. Nothing was too much trouble, even when we decided to change the venue after everything was booked. Jane has been amazing at dealing with all my questions and queries and coming up with solutions to any problems.  Sofia in Santorini was brilliant so much so that the first week of our holiday we didn&rsquo;t even think about the wedding! The beach bar is an incredible venue and took our breath away when we first saw it. The food, staff, drinks and setting were all amazing. It was a very romantic location.

					<p>We had such an amazing wedding, and it was all made better by having Ionian Weddings in charge. We got married in Zante and Ionian Weddings were brilliant at advising us and helping us with our plans throughout. There seems so much to have to think about but it really was so easy even down to the paperwork &ndash; which Ionian Weddings sorted out for us &ndash; Little things like this made it totally stress free. Everyone at the wedding said it was the best wedding they had ever been to. Having our own wedding planner is the way forward! The wedding must have been magical as since returning home 3 of the couples who attended our wedding are now engaged!! We&rsquo;ll recommend Ionian Weddings to them all.</p>

The horse and carriage was a special touch that all the guests commented on. Rob and I being driven through Tsivili on a horse and cart with all the people in the restaurants and bars coming out to cheer was one that we will never forget. The Greek band and dancers got everyone up dancing and added a nice Greek theme to the day. The fireworks to top it all off were fantastic.

					<p><strong>Fiona &amp; Ben, Agia Paraskevi, Crete, June 2011</strong></p>
					<p>We chose Ionian Weddings having experienced their high standard and attention to detail at a previous IW in Greece, therefore I had firsthand experience of the process/quality in which IW executed the day itself and the support offered. We chose Crete as I had travelled there before and knew that it was suitable for all ages, it has the quiet authentic Greek qualities in places such as Koutouloufari as well as the lively areas such as Hersonissos and Malia, it is also great for kids! We initially chose our ceremony to be held at the Greek Temple in Gouves, however decided to change location to Agia Paraskevi chapel by the Harbour in Hersonissos at the last minute, the views were breathtaking and our photos are amazing. We chose to have our reception in the Aphrodite Beach Club hotel in Gouves and we were delighted with their service, all our guests had a wonderful experience which was key for us. Food was excellent and everyone had a fabulous time at our beach bar disco by the sea.</p>

When my now husband and I arrived in Santorini we met our wedding planner, she was so warm and friendly spoke excellent English and went above and beyond to make our wedding day stress free, nothing is a problem for her, we were so pleased. I also chose to pay extra and use Helen and Kosta to do my bridesmaids hair and makeup as well as mine and she was so fantastic, Kosta was an excellent photographer and he put us all at ease. Andreas was fantastic who looked after us up until we flew out, making our wedding requests come true. I recommend Ionian Weddings, it was an excellent service. </p>

We had 60 guests travel to our wedding on Cameo Island in Zakynthos and everyone had the most amazing time. They said it was the best wedding they had ever been to and the setting was beautiful. The decorations at the venue and the flowers were gorgeous. Everything was so co-ordinated and getting married at 5pm was perfect. We both could not believe how amazing the fireworks were and the DJ, who played everything we wanted!

It was just how we'd imagined, and we have special memories that we'll cherish forever. Our friends were saying that it's one of the best weddings they've ever been to. The island is breathtaking, and despite it looking amazing on a photo, you can never appreciate its beauty until you're actually there. We were blown away by the views, and having our reception on the balcony overlooking them was spectacular. The help we received was much appreciated and we won't forget how helpful it was to us that you went that extra mile. The food was wonderful, and having the band on the beach was so romantic.

It was all so emotional and exciting and our guests enjoyed every minute! Some of which are even thinking of their own Greek wedding!

Riding through Tsilivi town with a coach load of guests with the horn blaring! Frances said they keep that a secret! I didn't know whether to be embarrassed or enjoy it! James loved every second and was waving all the way to the Alexandra Beach! I know lots of others do the same thing almost daily in June but we really did feel like royalty!

					<p>At first we were unsure who to use to organise our wedding on a Greek Island in May after looking at several websites we came across Ionian weddings. Their website stood out among everyone else&rsquo;s. After contacting Andreas we were sure that we had made the right decision. He suggested Zante, Cameo Island with reception at Alexandra Beach Bar and he was spot on, the venue was perfect for us &ndash; simply beautiful. We flew 39 guests to Zante and we had the time of our lives!!! My suggestion to future brides would be to let Andreas organise your wedding, his knowledge and professionalism shone through. Do not change anything even the little details were catered for &ndash; just perfect!! Our wedding exceeded our expectations and beyond &ndash; thank you so much.</p>

Everything fell into place, Lucynda looked beautiful she loved her hair , as did the bridesmaids the music worked really well everyone was very emotional because it was a piece Lucynda has listened to since she was quite young from Romeo and Juliet, the ceremony went really well all the guests were picked up and taken to the reception, and what a fantastic day Christos gave us, the the table decorations were lovely nothing was too much trouble we had our bellinis on the front terrace before sitting down to the best food we had all week and we had some great meals, everything was piping hot and the cake was delicious, the service was very discreet and professional and the best view looking out to the sea couldn&rsquo;t be topped and we danced till very late DJ great. All in all a wonderful wedding day, many thanks for all your organization the happy couple have another week in beautiful Santorini so Lucynda will be in touch on their return to let you see the photos. Regards Angela Breen.</p>

					<p>Santorini is the most beautiful Island in the world and Ionian made our dream wedding come true. Nothing was too much effort for them and everything was perfected down to the last detail. All the guests said it was the best wedding that they had ever attended and we will never forget our special day. Thank you so much, Mr &amp; Mrs Cunningham.</p>

					<p><strong>Tania &amp; Tom, Foki Beach, Kefalonia, May 2011</strong></p>
					<p>We had our wedding on Foki beach Kefalonia. Having the wedding team in Greece made it a very stress free experience. The team was available all day for us and looked after taking us to appointments such as the Mayor&rsquo;s office. The beach was beautiful and our guests had a great time! Overall I think it was much less stress and expense as well as unique compared to a UK wedding.</p>

					<p><strong>Rachel &amp; Dave, St Paul's bay wedding in Lindos (Rhodes) Greece followed by beachfront taverna reception, October 2010</strong></p>
					<p>We had a fantastic time! Couldn't have wished for a better day! Cathy, our wedding co-ordinator was great also. We were so pleased when we saw the band arrive at our reception as we had seen them the previous Friday and loved them! It was the best day of our lives which we wish could last forever. Everybody said it was the best wedding they had been to. I agree! So romantic, so well planned, and so much fun!!</p>

					<p><strong>Lisa &amp; Glenn, Santo Winery followed by a beachfront taverna reception, Santorini, September 2010</strong></p>
					<p>When we first decided to get married abroad, we didn't know where to start! So discovering Ionian Weddings was a blessing. We met Jane and Andreas at the Wedding Show - they were so lovely, really friendly and informative - and we knew we could work with them to plan out dream wedding. We were not disappointed. Jane was brilliant from start to finish. We had previously been to Santorini and loved it so we opted to get married in front of our 24 guests in Santo Winery. This was followed by sunset drinks, and then dinner at the restaurant in Kamari. Sophia, our wedding coordinator was excellent. The venue was absolutely stunning with amazing views. And the food and service at the restaurant was fantastic! Jane was helpful and very patient while we took our time in deciding what we wanted! The day went perfectly and there is nothing we would change. Thank you so much! If you want to get married in Greece - look no further! </p>

					<p><strong>Katherine &amp; Grant, St Irene Chapel and Perivolos Wedding, Santorini, September 2010</strong></p>
					<p>Our wedding was everything that we could have hoped for. Jane and Andreas were fantastic at arranging everything for us. Our wedding planner, Sofia, in Santorini was amazing at reassuring us and helping us make decisions and we couldn't of asked for a better service from Nikos at our reception. The Island itself is breath taking and a fantastic place to visit and explore.</p>

					<p><strong>Lucy &amp; John, St Paul's Bay wedding in Lindos, Rhodes, September 2010</strong></p>
					<p>When we decided to marry abroad we firstly looked at booking through a travel agent. Big mistake! They didn't have a clue about weddings. Tour operators specialise in holidays and I can definitely say that Ionian Weddings specialise in weddings. Everything was so easy from start to finish. We found out within 24 hours that we could marry at St Paul's Bay chapel in Lindos. There were very few slots still available but Andreas managed to secure one very quickly. It would have taken the tour operator 6 weeks to do this! All the paperwork and documents we needed were dealt with by Ionian Weddings. We sent them to Andreas who got them ready and sent off to Rhodes. We met Cathy our wedding co-ordinator in Rhodes the day after arriving. She went through final details with us about flowers cake, the ceremony. And she even arranged transport for all our guests. The wedding day was amazing! The location was beautiful and everything ran perfectly. Thank you!!</p>

					<p><strong>Alison &amp; Mark, Hotel wedding and Reception in Crete, September 2010</strong></p>
					<p>The service from Ionian Weddings was outstanding, both in the UK and Crete. Our wedding planner in Crete was above and beyond perfect, he made every second on the day magical. With nerves hitting on arrival in Crete, he made us relax and was so reassuring. The team in the UK made us confident that everything would be dealt with professionally and with us being very demanding, they met every request and answered every concern. Ionian Weddings will be recommended to everyone we know, their service was without doubt OUTSTANDING!! We ask that you don't change a thing, you are perfect! I can't express how much I want to thank you, Mark and I thank you from the bottom of our hearts.</p>

					<p><strong>Sarah &amp; Thomas, Kefalonia beach wedding, September 2010</strong></p>
					<p>Hi Andreas, we'd just like to say a huge thank you for everything that you and the Ionian Weddings team did to make our ceremony in Kefalonia so very, very special. Kefalonia was fantastic and our ceremony was amazing. Our driver was lovely, the readings and the vows made us cry, the photographer was very enthusiastic and VERY quick in getting our album to us, the flowers were gorgeous, the cake was divine and we couldn't have done any of it without Angela. She was an absolute star, and put us at ease as soon as we met her. She was also very goodatanswering all our silly questions! So thank you, for making our ceremony so perfect, for listening to all of our alterations and dealing with them so smoothly, for providing a tailormade package that did exactly what we wanted and for helping us start our married life in the most wonderful way possible.</p>
					<p>Sarah &amp; Thomas also sent in the following testimonial:</p>
					<p>Ionian Weddings arranged our ceremony in Kefalonia. Originally starting as a wedding on the beach with 30 guests, we changed our minds over and over again until we finally decided on a blessing on the beach for just the 2 of us. Ionian Weddings were fantastic: even up to a month before the day they were still happily listening to our ideas and changing the package for us. In Kefalonia our wedding co-ordinator, Angela, was friendly, efficient and practical. She had advice and ideas and even turned up for the ceremony to be our translator. And the ceremony was perfect: the car was gleaming, the flowers were the right colour and the cake was gorgeous. The ceremony had lots of lovely Greek traditions in it that we weren't expecting that made the day even more special. And to top it all our wedding co-ordinator arranged for us to have the album of pictures in our hands within 48 hours. Now that's good service!</p>

					<p><strong>Laura &amp; Ben, Chapel wedding and beachfront taverna reception in Crete, September 2010</strong></p>
					<p>Laura &amp; I decided on Crete as we met there whilst working and living on the island. We spoke to several travel companies and wedding planners but none was able to accommodate our wedding plans, that was until we found Ionian Weddings. After the very first email response from them we knew we were in good hands. From that point onwards they were nothing but fantastic. Nothing was too much trouble and every question we asked they answered promptly. I cannot express how thankful we are to Jane and her team for making our day such a special one. The support in the UK was second to none and on arrival we had a professional and capable local wedding planner who helped us with all our queries on the island, ensuring everything went to pan. If you want to get married on a Greek island make sure you use Ionian Weddings as you will not be disappointed. Thank you for making our wedding so special and unique.</p>

					<p>Ionian Weddings are just brilliant! They have amazing packages on offer which you can pick and choose from to make your own and they will always help you with any queries you may have. We were extremely impressed with how professionally they work, and as you see the photos on their website and read up on the information, that is how they are and we had the most beautiful, perfect day.

					<p><strong>Sandra &amp; Brian, parents of Suzanne, who attended her wedding in Zante</strong></p>
					<p>Hello Andreas, we have recently returned from Zakynthos where we attended our daughter Suzanne's wedding to Russell on 6th September. 36 guests thoroughly enjoyed what many of them (including my wife and I) said was the best wedding they had been to. Obviously the location and weather had a great deal to do with making this a special day for Suzanne and Russell but we must say the organisation of Ionian Weddings was excellent which made the occasion go smoothly. We'd be grateful if you could also pass on our sincere thanks to your team in Zante: Heather, Michele and Lucas for carrying out their duties with such professionalism and sense of enjoyment which enabled everyone to enjoy the day. Our thanks to one and all, Brian &amp; Sandra</p>

					<p>If you want an open air wedding in an amazing setting with views over the ocean then we suggest you speak to Ionian Weddings. We researched other wedding planners and none could provide the intimate wedding in a stunning location that we dreamed of. It really helps that they speak Greek! Our flowers, cake, photographer, wedding car and wedding meal were all arranged by Ionian Weddings and everything was perfect. All our guests said it was a beautiful day and thoroughly enjoyed themselves. We would definitely recommend Ionian Weddings to those who dream of the perfect wedding day.

					<p>Having a wedding on an island is the best way, you are not stressedatall, you have a nice tan and gorgeous pictures! I definitely recommend it!

					<p><strong>Elaine &amp; Glenn, Assos chapel wedding and taverna reception in Kefalonia, August 2010</strong></p>
					<p>My partner and I have been together for 17 years and finally decided to tie the knot. We had previously been to Greece and liked the idea of getting married there. We knew we wanted to go to Kefalonia as we'd been on day trip here and it looked like a beautiful island. We found Ionian Weddings and immediately liked the look of the website and read the testimonials from other couples. We opted for an August wedding in Assos, which we had only seen via the website. We were not disappointed, the pictures of this tiny village do not do it justice, we chose a chapel wedding as we wanted a very intimate wedding with only 4 other guests. The venue is so picturesque, serene and romantic and ideal for what we wanted. The taverna meal afterwards was wonderful, with a warm and friendly atmosphere and great food. A big thanks has to go out to Andreas and his wonderful team who made this all possible for us and made it so stress free. And also to Angela our wedding co-ordinator who is an amazing, friendly, warm person and made our day. We can't thank you all enough.</p>

					<p>Our wedding was everything and more special than we ever imagined and this was all thanks to Ionian Weddings. Andreas was so helpful and made sure we had everything we wanted, thank you so much for this. The added little extras such as the Greek dancing for the reception and fireworks were fab, especially the bouzouki serenade for the island was amazing by the way, and so very Greek which is what we wanted. We were over the moon with the flower arrangements, they were absolutely stunning and the flower arch was just perfect. The photographer was brilliant and the photos are beautiful. Nikos and Linda were really good and took away the wedding stress which was great as we were able to enjoy our holiday as well as our wedding day, thank you for this guys. Our whole experience of Ionian Weddings has been an excellent one and I would definitely recommend them to anyone, they are professional and have a lot of knowledge and experience with weddings in Greece. Thank you!</p>

					<p>Wow! I have not stopped looking at the photos in a desperate bid to relive the experience - the photographs are so beautiful and the photographer caught the moment perfectly. We were looked after so well by the wedding co-ordinators in Kefalonia - both Andreas &amp; Angela were only too happy to make sure our wedding was perfect. The beach was stunning at Myrtos and was set up exactly how I had dreamed of. The reception venue was also perfect. My sister in law said it was the best fish she had ever tasted! Fiskardo was beautiful and the perfect place to stay - the local people in tavernas and shops regularly gave us wedding advice and small gifts during our stay. I would recommend Ionian Weddings to anyone who is thinking of a wedding abroad and I must say that Kefalonia is the most beautiful island tht I have visited in the Ionian. Thanks so much to Andreas in London, we will never forget this amazing day and honeymoon we had. Wish we could do it all over again, the time flew by too quickly. Love James and Anneka x</p>

					<p>Hi Jane, just back this week, we had the most wonderful time. Everything went smoothly and it was so easy. You hear so often about all the dramas surrounding weddings but we had nothing but good things happen for us. We enjoyed every moment of it and so did our guests.</p>
					<p>We have nothing but praise for you and your team: Sofia was very professional and friendly, Kostas was excellent and the photos are lovely too! The food was lovely and we hired the room behind the terrace for cake cutting and dancing which was worth the extra. Thanks again Jane to you and your team for all your efforts.</p>

					<p>Ionian Weddings made the planning and organisation of our Santorini wedding so easy and stress free.</p>
					<p>We live in Australia and so we wouldn't have been able to do this on our own, I found Jane to be extremely helpful and patient when answering all my emails. It can be difficult planning a wedding but to do it long distance is even more daunting.</p>
					<p>When we arrived in Fira we were met by Ionian Weddings' co-ordinator, Sofia who helped us to complete the final touches and set everything up on the day. Overall it was the most amazing experience, we had the best day with no stress at all. We both thoroughly enjoyed every minute and have great memories of the day.

					<p>I would encourage anyone to get married in Greece, such a beautiful and romantic setting.

They can be assured that both Ionian Weddings and the wedding co-ordinators in Greece will give them the best day they have ever had. I am sure that all locations available are spectacular though our beach wedding in Tsilivi was everything we could have wished for and more. We would like to thank Andreas and Jane from the bottom of our hearts for our brilliant wedding from which we and our guests will treasure the memories forever. Nothing was too much trouble and all the reassurance was really calming! It was the very best start to married life that we could imagine.</p>

					<p><strong>Justine &amp; Jon, Wedding at Nidri Beach, Lefkas, July 2010</strong></p>
					<p>After deciding to marry on the beautiful island of Lefkas (at Nidri), our story begins....Initially sceptical and after much deliberation, we decided to go for it and decided on Ionian Weddings, after reading through a number of positive reviews on their website. It was one of the best decisions we have ever made. Through initial contact to our wedding itself, everything fell into place perfectly. Andreas at Ionian Weddings was informative and helpful throughout. Our wedding planner in Nidri and her arrangements were faultless. Also big thanks to our photographer....again faultless. So from "initial scepticism" we ended up at "total satisfaction". The best word to describe the wedding (&amp; all the planning that went with it).....PERFECT!...Jon &amp; Justine</p>

					<p>We could not have wished for a better wedding day. We got married at the Bourtzi then had a boat trip in the day with all our guests. Jane has been fantastic from start to finish and the wedding organisers in Skiathos were great too. Skiathos is a beautiful island and I would certainly recommend to get married there and to book with Ionian Weddings as we are so glad we did. Thank you, Claire &amp; David xx </p>

					<p>Hello Jane, thank you for the welcome home! The wedding was absolutely perfect - truly. Sofia our wedding co-ordinator was even more charming, efficient and helpful than expected and successfully managed all points within the wedding itinerary to make this an unforgettable experience. The two photographers were also a wonderful addition to the event as was our magistrate. The flowers were perfect, the cake was perfect, the location and sunset were perfect - really, it all could not have been better. The photographers were able to process the many pictures that were taken overnight - this for a complete wedding album is unprecedented in my experience. Many kudos to your team Jane!</p>

					<p><strong>Emma &amp; Ian, Corfu Catholic wedding, June 2010</strong></p>
					<p>We challenged Ionian Weddings to create the wedding of our dreams. This included a ceremony in the Catholic church of Corfu and a reception at our favourite place in Paxos. The challenge here is that Corfu and Paxos are 1.5 hours from each other by boat! Ionian Weddings not only rose to the challenge but they also delivered an amazing party atmosphere from start to finish by helping with transport, locations and even musicians! The day was relaxing and totally stress fee, and watching the guests' faces as each element of the day unfolded meant that it was not only the best day of our lives but also many of our guests have told us that it was the best wedding they had been to! We truly believe it was the passion of Jane and Andreas that made the difference and the personal touch in taking time to understand us, our personalities and our dream. It also came in far cheaper than our UK wedding budget with guaranteed sunshine.</p>

					<p><strong>Julie &amp; Adrian, Wedding at Assos Kefalonia, June 2010</strong></p>
					<p>Our wedding in Assos in June 2010 was everything and more than we'd hoped for. The location is amazing, the website does not do it justice! Following our ceremony outside the chapel on the hill with the most outstanding views we strolled back (about 10 mins walk) to a gorgeous taverna. It looked stunning, decorated in white as we had requested, overlooking the sea. The food was fantastic and there was plenty of it. Our guests were amazed at how wonderful it all was. Many are wanting to go back for a holiday and one couple are now planning to get married there too. I cannot stress enough how much we all enjoyed both the holiday in Kefalonia and the wedding day itself. I would do nothing differently. My last mention must go to the DJ who again was friendly, helpful and had every single record that we requested on the night. Book your wedding with Ionian Weddings and enjoy......</p>

					<p><strong>Gayel &amp; Lovell, Wedding at St Irene chapel Santorini and reception at Perivolos, June 2010</strong></p>
					<p>We picked Ionian Weddings because I really liked the website. After speaking with Andreas we felt that this was the right place for us. Andreas was always so helpful and patient with me and always responded to emails and phonecalls promptly. He advised us of different options available and helped with so much inlcuding the paperwork. Nothing felt like it was too much trouble to them. As a first time bride I was unsure of what would happen when we arrived in beautiful Santorini but after meeting with Sofia and being taken to all the different places concerned we felt so much at ease. Santorini is such a beautiful island and that's why we picked it for our wedding. the wedding day arrived and was absolutely amazing. Sofia was on hand to help with anything. Anyone thinking of a wedding abroad can rest assured that if they put their faith in Ionian Weddings they won't be disappointed. Thank you to all of your team, Mr &amp; Mrs Hailwood xxxxx</p>

Lying on the beach the day before we couldn't believe it was all taken care of and we had nothing to worry about except topping up our tans. Our wedding day was perfect - what a beautiful setting. Walking through the streets of Lindos the locals and tourists alike were congratulating us and we had to stop several times to pose for photos! A small crowed had gathered at St Georges when they realised a wedding was about to take place and the taverna up the street played the wedding march especially for us! The beach taverna was also excellent, the food and service and the decorations. Just perfect - we haven't stopped smiling since. Thank you so much.</p>

					<p>Thank you for helping us to organise the wedding of our dreams in beautiful Kefalonia. It could not have been more perfect and from the offset Ionian Weddings guided us through every step. Every little detail was taken care of, from the paperwork down to the finer details like the floral arrangements and the cake (which was to die for!!). I'm so glad we had the mandolin player who reduced everybody to tears! The chapel you suggested in Karavados was beautiful with the most amazing views over the sea. The photographer captured some wonderful memories in a lovely album and the fact that we got the disk to take home with all the photos was a bonus. We were lucky enough to have 20 of our family &amp; friends there to celebrate with us and all have agreed that it was the most magical, unforgettable day. We will certainly recommend Ionian Weddings to anyone lucky enough to be planning a Greek wedding.</p>

					<p><strong>Fiona &amp; Ian, Catholic wedding in Zante with beach party reception, May 2010</strong></p>
					<p>Hello Andreas, the wedding was incredible! I cannot quite put into words the feelings that both of us are feeling right now. Everything was amazing and we cannot quite get over the fact that it was all for us. You guys really pulled out all the stops for us and we will be so grateful for the rest of our lives. Here is out testimonial:</p>
					<p>We watched the Mamma Mia DVD a lot and decided to cancel our wedding venue in the UK to escape to Greece so that we could experience the wonderful church wedding and beach reception. Finding Ionian Weddings via the internet was the easy part, the hard part for us was trying to narrow down the wide range of options and ideas that Andreas gave us. Ian works away off shore for 6 months of the year and all of our bookings were completed via email. We really should meet you Andreas! The key element in all of our emails was for a fairytale wedding experience including a horse and carriage and I think Ian and I would have been very happy if we got just that....but we didn't! Andreas and the wonderful team in Zakynthos gave us so much more than we could ever have imagined and the hospitality of the Greek people is out of this world. </p>
					<p>Imagine being married and upon leaving the Church to be met by young children on a school trip singing to you and rejoicing in your happiness. Imagine a private little cove of a beach with a jetty and the backdrops that you see only in adverts with no one there but yourselves and your guests. Imagine fairly lights that look like fireflies, candles of all different colours, shapes and sizes that mimic a midsummer night's dream. Now try to imagine that all of this was for you. That is the memory that Ian and I will have forever.</p>
					<p>All I can say is thank you, thank you, thank you. I think we'll have to come back to you guys to organise the baptism!!</p>

					<p><strong>Shanta &amp; Matt Stripp, Lefkas wedding, May&nbsp;2009</strong></p>
					<p>Once we decided to marry in Greece, we didn&rsquo;t know what to do next.&nbsp; We spoke to travel agents who seemed more interested in a possible group holiday booking.&nbsp; Then we found Ionian Weddings and from our meeting with Andreas we knew that he could make our wedding day special!&nbsp; Andreas&rsquo; knowledge of the Greek islands helped us to decide where we wanted to have our wedding. Having chosen the beautiful island of Lefkas, he gave us lots of ideas for ceremony and reception venues. We selected a package to suit us, including photographer and hairdresser for the day.&nbsp; We were able to hand over all the legal paperwork to Ionian weddings for translation and their wedding co-ordinator in Nidri took care of the finer details: flowers, venue decorations, menu and music.&nbsp; Our wedding day was amazing! It will always be one of the most memorable weeks for us and all our family and friends.&nbsp; For me, it was the single most amazing day of my life! We&rsquo;d definitely recommend getting married in Greece.&nbsp; Thank you Ionian Weddings for a fantastic day!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

					<p><strong>Anna and Toby English - 26 June 2008</strong></p>
					<p>With the help of Ionian Weddings we have been able to create our dream wedding in Kefalonia! Right from the initial planning stages through to the finite (and important!) details of the ceremony and reception - such as the floral arrangements, choosing the perfect menu for our guests and sorting out a fantastic hairdresser - they have been there every step of the way and no detail was too big (or small!) for them to handle. When we had our personal consultation, they suggested the most suitable locations for our budget and the type of wedding we were looking for and after a recce in Zakynthos and Kefalonia (where again appointments were arranged for us) we decided on the fantastic Emelisse Hotel in Fiskardo with it's beautiful views of the Ionian and a stunning outside chapel and open air reception area for our guests. It really couldn't have been a more wonderful wedding and Ionian Weddings have played a huge role in that! They frequently emailed with updates on all the arrangements and in addition were a great help in organising extras we needed. It obviously helped greatly that they speak the language as they were able to communicate every little detail to the hotel, which myself and my husband would have struggled with - what saints you were! Our friends and family have all commented on how beautiful the setting was and how well organised it was and we agree! We really couldn't have done it without Ionian Weddings and couldn't have asked for a more perfect and magical day. Thank you so much! With love from a very happy couple!</p>

					<p><strong>Jayne &amp; Chris Redrup - 31 August 2008</strong></p>
					<p>What can we tell you about the Wedding of 2008??!! We had the most fantastic wedding and the most fantastic reception and you, your planner and the beautiful Island of Zakynthos, did us proud! All the little extras were fantastic, the horse and carriage rides, the smart seat covers in the garden, the coach to get everybody to the beach bar and best of all, as they will provide great memories in the years to come, the photographer was superb! The whole thing was like a dream, nothing could have gone better than it did and we have left a lot of people remarking on the fact they have never been to a wedding that came close to ours and they doubt they ever will, which is exactly what we wanted them to say given the different sacrifices etc., everybody had to make to be with us. Would you believe we had surprise guests who flew in from Australia just for that weekend? I can&rsquo;t thank you enough for putting things together for us, it was truly magnificent.</p>

					<p><strong>Charlie &amp; David Melleney - 17 September 2008</strong></p>
					<p>Since returning from Corfu, I have found it difficult to explain in words the experience you provided for us. Firstly, your service was second to none, you answered all my questions with such patience and you not only provided a professional service but a personal one. For lack of a better word, the wedding was &ldquo;spectacular&rdquo;. I wouldn&rsquo;t change a thing on the day, the Greek vows were perfect, and the mayor was funny and really came to life once we popped the champagne. We felt like real celebrities walking around the town having our photos taken. We had the public just stopping to wish us a great future and taking their own photos. I can only describe the experience as &ldquo;surreal&rdquo;. The photographer was amazing, his work was fantastic he provided our photos to us just 2 days after the event. The video was superb, I have not seen anything like it, and the footage was great he was in the right place at the right time at every point needed. I am so glad we booked the musicians they was just perfect, I could not imagine the day without them, they added at great touch the wedding. The wedding cake and flowers were beautiful, better then I had ever expected, I even brought the bouquet back with me. We cannot thank you enough and we will highly recommend your services. Once again many thanks for providing such a magnificent wedding with memories to last a lifetime.</p>

					<p><strong>Jo &amp; Patrick Morris - 11 June 2008</strong></p>
					<p>Ionian Weddings arranged a really special and memorable wedding day for us. It really reflected our personalities and they listened carefully to what we wanted and offered us a great choice of options. Our photos are great; well shot, well presented and very professional. We have a lovely album to show off and even a CD of the images, which is great because we can print off copies for our family and guests. The reception venue was lovely, such a beautiful place and the decorations were really nice. All our guests had a fantastic time and many said it was the best wedding they had ever been to. What a great compliment! </p>
