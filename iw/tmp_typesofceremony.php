Zante has a private island where you can hire the beach cove exclusively for your wedding and on Turtle Island you can enjoy a simple barefoot beach wedding.  Kos has a tiny island off Kefalos where you can enjoy a private wedding ceremony outside a traditional white washed chapel.  Or you could marry on historic Spinalonga, made famous in the recent bestselling novel &quot;The Island&quot;.  Nearby is a pretty lake, unusually situated in the heart of the resort of Aghios Nikolaos - you can exchange your vows here, outside a pretty chapel built into the rocks.</p>
<p>For a boat wedding, Lefkas is the perfect destination, offering traditional sailing boats on which to exchange your vows, perhaps with the famous Skorpios island in the background (where Jackie Kennedy and Aristotle Onassis were married).  In Cyprus you can get married on a catamaran and then sail around the Mediterranean for your reception.  Or why not enjoy a boat trip with your guests after your wedding?  In Rhodes you can sail from St Paul's bay to your wedding reception, in Corfu you can sail from Corfu Town up to your chosen taverna on the North East coast, or hire your own private boat to bring you and your guests over from Paxos and in Kefalonia you can enjoy a 2 hour champagne sailing cruise from Skala.</p>
